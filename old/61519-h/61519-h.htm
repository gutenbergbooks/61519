<h2 id="INTRODUCTION">INTRODUCTION</h2>
</div>

<p>It is a safe bet that when the German army
started for Paris they had plans for use in the
event of disaster. The disaster occurred, and
a new type of warfare requiring the highest
courage, skill and endurance was born. I say
born because although trench warfare was
known before, it died in birth compared to this
war, for the amount of science, energy and
variety of weapons used.</p>

<p>More earth has been removed by a combination
of man, pick and shovel in making these
trenches than was excavated to make the Panama
Canal possible, and in less time.</p>

<p>It is my object in this book to give a faint
idea and knowledge of the trenches, and to approximately
explain the way warfare is carried
on, and I offer the information contained herein
as a basic foundation on which to use the
further knowledge you will gain as an officer,
and which, for obvious reasons, I will not and
cannot give here.</p>

<p>The notes are all taken from different courses<span class="pagenum" id="Page_viii">viii</span>
of instruction, and observations made during
thirty-one months of service, fifteen of which
was spent on the Belgian and French fronts,
both as private and officer in the infantry
service.</p>

<p>I do not lay down my information as expert
and final by any means, but as trench warfare
changes from day to day, improvements are
made, old ideas discarded, new ones tried, it
can be seen that nothing can be laid down as
a cut and dried rule, but the principles of trench
building, generally speaking, remain the same.
This I have endeavored to give, along with a
few other notes which will give an idea of the
many and varied tasks that a second lieutenant
must know before he is fit to take hold of men
in a place such as the Western Front, where
there is very seldom a chance to rectify mistakes,
or to experiment more than once.</p>

<p>When the British and French armies started
their retreat from Mons, as far as the British
army was concerned they were hampered by
their want of knowledge of trench warfare as
used in the South African war. The men retired
day by day, hardly staying in one place
long enough to dig themselves in. At that time
for digging a trench system, one valuable lesson
was learned, and that was, that the hole<span class="pagenum" id="Page_ix">ix</span>
such as they had been taught to make in just
such circumstances as they were up against then
was no good, as it offered them no protection
from overhead shrapnel, and at the best of
times made a very poor shelter. This hole used
to be dug a little more than the width of a man
and straight back his full length, he naturally
throwing the dirt in front of him and thus making
a little parapet.</p>

<p>When the battle of the Marne commenced and
the British and the French drove forward,
this valuable lesson and many others had been
learned, so that when the armies had reached
the limits of their endurance, instead of digging
themselves in in the old style, a new system was
used, greatly assisted by shell fire.</p>

<p>A round hole was dug by each man to fit his
individual size and made to suit himself. Here
he squatted and fought, if necessary, and got
what rest was possible during that day, with
the enemies’ line at distances varying from 100
to 500 yards from him. During the night, these
men when not fighting or bothered by counter-attacks,
or trying to obtain rations, water and
the many necessaries that a fighting man requires,
deepened their shelters and joined them
together by little narrow ditches. During the
next day there might be bitter fighting, so it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_x">x</span>
would be even possible that other troops would
come up and relieve during the early dusk. The
relieved troops would retire a short distance
and dig themselves another row of little holes
where they might act as supports in case the
temporary front line gave. During that night
the holes on the front line would be enlarged
until they finally joined and gradually without
deliberate intention the trench became a permanent
feature. Then the line slightly in the
rear became connected with the front line system
by what were then nothing more or less
than ditches and this was the birth of the present
system which now stretches from the sea to
Switzerland.</p>

<p>The trench systems now generally consist of
three complete lines or systems of trenches,
each system being self-supporting and independent
of the other. The second and third
systems are generally laid with due consideration
to protection, fields of fire, and all the
other tactical requirements that are necessary to
such a system; it being impossible in the majority
of cases to keep these points in mind during
the building of the first or original line. These
systems generally run to a depth of six to eight
miles from the front firing line. They are so
constructed that when a firing line has been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xi">xi</span>
broken through to any great extent, what was
formerly a communication trench at once becomes
a fire trench, and serves to bring a heavy
enfilade fire on the troops occupying the captured
area.</p>

<p>It must be remembered that the considerations,
arguments, and notes laid down in this
book cannot, under stress of circumstances, always
be acted on. It will be found, however,
that a certain amount of training and of study
as to the conditions governing the sighting,
building, and living in these trenches, will cause
a man, even under great stress of excitement, to
look for and try to obtain the ideal as a matter
of habit and without giving much time and
thought to the question.</p>

<p>The Art of War is “the greatest amount of
common sense used in the shortest possible
time.”</p>

</div>

<h2 id="LOCATION_AND_CONSTRUCTION_OF" class="nobreak p2">LOCATION AND CONSTRUCTION OF
TRENCHES</h2>

<p>In locating the site for a defensive firing line,
it must be divided into three sections:—firing
line, immediate support and reserves. In doing
this several opposing factors should be taken
into consideration and their relative importance
judged according to the special circumstances
and objects in view, keeping in mind the probable
lines and manner of defense of the enemy,
and whether the trenches are for permanent or
for temporary use.</p>

<p>This may be summarized under two heads:
first, with the object of attaining the greatest
field that can be covered by defensive fire; and,
second, the greatest security from offensive fire.</p>

<p>It will even be found that these two constructions
will be in conflict. Trenches placed behind
the crest of a hill, say fifty to one hundred
and fifty yards from the top, will hamper the
accuracy of the enemy’s artillery fire. Shooting,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">2</span>
to be effective, calls for a high rate of accuracy,
and here the only observations possible
are from aircraft and balloons; but the enemy
side of the hill will be raised ground to the occupants
of the trench. At night large numbers
of the enemy could collect there, and the dangerous
space to them would merely be the distance
from your fire trench to the crest of the
hill.</p>

<p>The enemy could and would entrench themselves
on their side of the crest and by raising
their parapet enjoy the advantage of a higher
front, which would eventually lead to their entirely
controlling the area behind your trenches,
which are continually used by the relief and
fatigue parties.</p>

<p>It is a principle that grazing rifle fire upon
a defensive enemy is more effective than plunging
fire, but any entrenched position higher
than your own held by an enemy gives them a
tremendous advantage. Regardless of what
opinion may be held as to the maximum depth
of a field of fire required to meet or repel
attacks, whether in masse or open order, it
should be obvious that the greater the depth
of the field of fire and the more extensive the
view of the enemy’s operations, the better it
will be for the defending forces.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">3</span>
Protection from and localization of artillery
fire must be provided by the internal construction
of the trench rather than by a position
that protects but also restricts the field of fire.
There are frequently found in front of a firing
line small areas of ground which are not covered
by direct fire from your trench. A flanking
fire frequently can cover these areas, but in
spite of this, they must be watched constantly
by means of listening posts or concealed observation
posts, which may be hidden by the banks
of rivers, hedges, ruined houses, or whatever
natural existing concealment renders observation
possible.</p>

<p>At night, it is a safe principle to support listening
posts by automatic rifles, trip wires with
noise making arrangements attached to them
as common sense under the circumstances dictates.
Great care and caution must always be
taken to prevent the discovery of these listening
posts by the enemy, and when discovered,
alternative posts should be made or greater
care taken for the protection of the men occupying
these posts, such as overhead protection by
mesh wire against bombing, and the upkeep
of a small supply of bombs and close-range
weapons in the post. The important trenches
on the front having been located with a view<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">4</span>
of protecting the immediate front and with due
regard to their relation, tactically, to the
other trenches already located, the connecting
trenches obviously must be subservient to the
more important ones. Every endeavor must be
made to avoid enfilade fires in the flanks, to give
and to receive mutual support, and in particular
to support those flanks which are not protected
otherwise.</p>

<p>It is an essential consideration in the location
of all these trenches that lateral communications
can be established, and that supplies, supports,
reserves, ammunition, etc., together with
the means of retiring if necessary be taken into
account. The distance from the water supplies
and the possibility of concealing approaches
is a further governing factor, although in many
cases an ideal condition cannot be realized.</p>

<p>Then there is the counter attack, in case the
fire trench should be taken, and the kind of soil
which is so essential to its relation to bad
weather and water seepage—these also require
thought and study.</p>

<p>These things are main considerations to be
kept in mind after a line has been settled
on, whether during attack or whether siting
trenches under common circumstances. It is
not expected and is not necessary, when trying<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">5</span>
to obtain a position during attack, to keep all
of these conditions in mind, but it is essential
that when the attack has been finished and
things return to slightly more normal circumstances,
that these things be given instant consideration
and proper action taken.</p>

<p>Were such a thing as concealment possible,
it should be the first thing of importance to be
kept in mind. Listening posts, machine gun
positions, reserve dugouts, company, battalion
and regimental headquarters, and similar
things, at some distance behind or on fire lines,
may be concealed, but fire-trenches are sure to
be observed sooner or later (mostly sooner) by
aeroplane and other means of observation, and
it is best that one should admit the impracticability
of concealment at once and take the
proper protective measures. If opportunity for
concealment offers itself, as it may do, according
to the lay of the land, it should be taken
always. It should always be kept in mind that
one should try to place himself in the position
of having the enemy’s point of view, both from
his trenches and his aerial observations.</p>

<p>Advantage should be taken and even care
given along trenches to the extensive cultivation
of the weeds, grasses, etc., that may grow
rapidly in the excavated soil.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span>
It is, and always will be, a matter of much
argument that trenches should not be dug near
hedges, ditches, roads or rows of trees, on account
of easy ranging mark given to the enemy
artillery. In a country where such things are
scarce, the idea may have a leg to stand on, but
certainly to the Western Front it does not apply.
It does not take artillery a moment to approximate
by ranging shot, check by deduction
or addition the range of trenches in any
area, even if lying along a hedge or road. The
ditch or hedge in some cases will provide the
starting of a trench and offer fair amount of
cover from fire to the troops working. A ditch
immediately in front or behind the trench
greatly helps to solve the many and varied difficulties
of drainage, and when in front of a
trench, can be made into a formidable obstacle,
generally by throwing in varied lengths of
barbed wire. Trenches under the cover of a
hedge are very often safe from aerial observation,
and even when located, sniping and observation
can be carried on from them if the contours
of the ground are favorable. It is always
possible to do a certain amount of repairing
and moving of troops only when unobserved
from the enemy’s trenches. If advantage
is not taken of these natural protections,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span>
such as hedges and trees, then they must be destroyed.</p>

<p>It is obvious that a great deal of labor can
be lost and work thrown away if a policy is not
adopted and continued. Battalions relieving
one another up and down the line may waste
a tremendous amount of labor unless the relieved
officer’s policy is explained. If each commanding
officer of a relieving battalion is permitted
to air his own theories, duplication of
work and lack of continuity will exist. Therefore,
it is essential that the officers relieving the
trench be thoroughly informed of work going
on. With this object in view some of the officers
of the relieving battalion should do a tour
of duty (about 24 hours) before their troops
take over the trench. An Officer and Non-Commissioned
Officer are detailed from each relieving
company for this duty. In the trench this
officer is instructed by the senior officer present,
and the non-commissioned officer by the
ranking non-commissioned officer, in the policy
to be continued. The commanding officer of
the occupying company should have a sketch
map of his sector of trench which he turns over
to the relieving officer. This map should show
the work under construction; proposed work;
wire defenses; and if possible, the enemies machine<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span>
gun emplacements, observation posts,
snipers and work in progress. The notes accompanying
the map should give the general
conditions concerning the work—depth to which
it is safe to dig, nature of soil, conditions regarding
drainage, and all information in regard
to the enemies’ activities during the period of
occupancy. In addition, the relieving officer has
the trench diary showing all the information
covering every minute detail of the happenings
during that company’s stay in the trenches.
This diary is a continuous record of that particular
sector and remains with the occupying
company until it is relieved and then passes into
the possession of the relieving half company,
and so on, forming a continuous running record
of the policy applying to the upkeep and
methods employed therein. This diary, unless
it is buried to avoid falling into the hands of
the enemy, will continue until the end of the
war. So every half company inherits one from
his predecessor in the line upon its assuming
the obligations previously assumed by its fore-runner,
thus preventing a duplication of work
and assuring continuity of endeavor.</p>

<p>There are certain obvious requirements that
have to become rules. When required to fill
sandbags, always look for the nearest excavation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span>
being made and fill from there, if distance
permits.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, in every trench there is
a continuous revetting, widening of communications
or control trenches, or driving of a
tunnel to a listening post.</p>

<div id="ip_9" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 38em;">
  <img src="images/i_009.png" width="600" height="307" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><p><i>A—Parapet Traverse</i></p>
 <p><i>B—Parados Traverse</i></p>
 <p><i>TRAVERSED &amp; RECESSED TRENCH.</i></p></div></div>

<p>Inasmuch as the time for filling sandbags
is never ending, if work is being done and the
earth is not absolutely needed for parapet or
parados, the earth, if dry, should be put in
sandbags, and, if necessary, stored until it is
needed. The repair work that is most necessary
takes precedent and is about as follows: Any
damage to parados or traverses should be immediately
attended to. During the night any
damage to the wire entanglements must be repaired.
Drainage comes next in order of importance,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span>
and this involves the digging of sumps
and deepening of the drainage bottom. These
are the repairs, but improvements must continually
be made in the dugouts and communication
trenches.</p>

<p>The ultimate design of a fire-trench depends
upon its closeness to the enemy. When the
latter are within 150 yards, the traversed fire-trench
shown in sketch should be employed,
as it provides adequate accommodation and protection
for men who may at any moment be
called upon to make use of bomb, bayonet and
bullet; but if the enemy trenches are more than
150 yards distant, the ultimate design would
depend upon the number of machine guns and
automatic rifles available. Each of these guns
has a firing capacity of about 25 rifles. Each
gun therefore gives a reduction in the number
of men required to hold the line, and in consequence
reduces the amount of trench needed to
protect these men.</p>

<p>A design, known as the “T” shaped fire-trench,
makes an adaptable basis for entrenching
under these conditions. Many lengths of
a continuous traversed trench have no great
field of fire, and yet, having been dug, they must
be held, and unless properly held and kept in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span>
repair, they naturally become a source of
danger.</p>

<p>As shown in the sketch, a traversed trench
consists of a series of fire-bays interrupted by
a series of traverses. The object of these being
to localize the effect of shells or bombs landing
in a fire-bay, and preventing enfilade fire down
the length of the trench, as well as localizing
any entry of the enemy into your line.</p>

<p>Dimensions vary up and down the line.
Sometimes according to the lay of the land,
sometimes according to the opinions, whims or
fancies of the regiments making them, but the
following dimensions should be kept in mind,
and it will be found that they show the average
of the whole general line on the Western Front.</p>

<p>Fire-bays generally are from 12 to 18 feet
long (defendable by 4 to 6 men, but accommodating
8 to 12, when necessary) plus a 2-ft. covered
sentry box recessed into the traverse and
giving room for one more man; this depending
entirely on the energy and initiative of the men
occupying the section.</p>

<p>Every traverse averages 9´ x 9´ which includes
a fairly liberal allowance for wear and
tear, and is the minimum allowance for stopping
enfilade fire and localizing fire. As the
width from front to rear varies, depending on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span>
the amount of shell fire, it should be wide
enough to allow a certain amount of lateral
traffic without interfering with those who may
be firing. Three feet may be taken as the maximum
width at the bottom of the trench, that is,
1½´ for traffic and 1½´ for those firing, with a
slope to the sides of from 10 to 15 degrees from
perpendicular, thus lessening the tendency of
the walls, whether revetted or otherwise, to
slide in.</p>

<p>The depth of the trenches varies also, for
the same reasons that cause the width to vary.
Recesses should also be dug at various and favorable
places for the storing of ammunition
and bombs.</p>

<p>When digging entrenchments without regard
to concealment, the excavated soil is first
of all thrown to the front or enemy’s side of the
trench, thus temporary cover is obtained.
When the entrenchment has reached the proper
depth the artificial raising of the ground is leveled.
The artificially raised portion is known
as the parapet. On the completion of the parapet,
the soil is thrown to the rear side of the
trench, thus forming the parados which gives
a protection from the rear. It is not a good policy
to excavate in front of the parapet, but to
get additional height and thickness as quickly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span>
as possible this is often done. Unless carefully
watched, men will dig this dirt from places
as near the parapet as possible, resulting in the
weakening or total undermining of the parapet
or trench wall. The more gradual the forward
slope of the parapet, the more does it approximate
as it should to the glacis of a fort, consequently
giving less cover to an attacking enemy.
Make use of the ditch or holes from which
the dirt was obtained, as a strong obstacle immediately
in front of your trench, where the enemy
at the last moment may be held up to go
under a very severe rifle and bombing effort.
In normal circumstances, by which I mean when
not exposed to an unduly vigorous machine gun
or artillery fire, the soil should not be taken
from in front of the trench in the manner described
above, closer than 10 to 15 feet from
the actual parapet, unless the holes are adequately
protected by trip wire, as well as barbed
wire. Cases have occurred when valuable information
has been obtained by the enemy lying
in holes thus dug and not properly protected.</p>

<p>The parapet should be kept as low as possible
and made to blend with its surroundings as
much as possible. This is done by taking great
care to cover any signs which show that fresh
work has been done, even to the extent of actually<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span>
planting grasses, weeds and roots, such
as grow in the immediate neighborhood, and
giving every encouragement to those that already
grow. This greatly hinders the enemy’s
artillery, as it changes positions up and down
the line; interfering with and hindering the
observations and accurate ranging by their forward
observing officers, checking charts turned
over by relieved batteries.</p>

<p>Bullet-proof nature of a parapet naturally
depends on the soil of which it is composed.
Although it is not necessary to memorize the
minimum of safety, you should keep a general
rule in your head. The parapet should not be
less than five feet, regardless of the kind of
soil. When the trench has been carefully sited
for the actual field of fire from a ground level,
this thickness is best obtained by raising the
ground level artificially as little as possible and
getting the necessary depth by digging, unless
prevented by moisture.</p>

<p>Unnecessary casualties are caused by the
practice of putting a single row of sand bags
along the top of a parapet for temporary purposes
of concealment, as it gives a faulty idea
to the men in the trench as to the real height
of the parapet.</p>

<p>The parados gives protection from the effect<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span>
of shell fire bursting behind the trench, and
should be made fire-proof as soon as possible,
although it is not necessary unless concealment
is possible to level it down in a similar manner
to the parapet. As a matter of fact, it should
be at least a foot higher than the parapet, thus
providing a background for the parapet. It has
been known to happen that when the occupants
of a trench have been reached by the enemy
they have vacated their trench and used the
parados as a parapet, much to the surprise and
disgust of the enemy. In a high and irregular
parados, places could even be found which when
not used steadily provide unexpected and safe
observation and sniping posts, but care must be
taken that they are not used too often.</p>

<p>If a trench were used merely for firing,
4½ feet from bottom of trench to top of parapet
would be a sufficient depth. During attack,
however, when fire from loopholes is too restricted,
exposure of head and shoulders over
the parapet becomes necessary, but it is not
necessary to expose men moving along the
trench and not actually firing. If the trench
should be 7´ or 8´ deep, you must provide a platform
at the bottom of the front wall 1¼´ wide
and 4½´ from the top of the parapet. This is
called a fire-step. The rest of the trench can<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span>
be deepened to any desired depth, depending on
the energy displayed. If of an extraordinary
depth, steps must be cut to the fire platform.</p>

<p>In a great many different parts of the Western
Front, especially Belgium, it was found that
after digging to a depth of one to three feet
water was encountered to such an extent that it
became impossible to dig any sort of a trench
which would give adequate protection to the
men involved.</p>

</div></div>

<p>When these conditions are run into, breast
work parapets must be artificially built up
above ground level with soil, sods and sandbags,
supported by sandbags, hurdles or close
wire netting, revetment and stakes. The same
principles of thickness, depth, width, slopes,
and in fact everything that applies to a dug-in
trench, applies to breast works.</p>

<div id="ip_16b" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 38em;">

  <div class="caption"><p><i>A—Link Trench, minimum length 5 ft.</i></p>
  <p><i><span class="smcap">“S” &amp; “T” Trench.</span></i></p></div></div>

<p>The “T” trench has many more advantages<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span>
than the few mentioned in the opening of this
chapter. T fire-bays may be single, double or
treble (that is with one, two or three bays).
Fire-bays in any length up to 15 feet with 8
feet traverses are for firing purposes only, and
the control trench, sometimes known as the
lateral communication trench, as its name implies,
giving lateral communications, is used
for that purpose only. Therefore, the fire-bays
and control trenches can be narrower than
trenches which have to be used for both purposes,
thus lessening the amount of repair and
revetment work required. And the intervening
ground between these fire-bays gives the same
result as a traverse used in a traversed trench
system, and saves the labor of digging a more
intricate system. The control trench gives an
officer or N. C. O. in charge of the T bays a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span>
chance to handle his men and fire in these bays
without struggling around innumerable traverses
and wasting time very often when a minute
lost or gained means lives lost, or part of a
trench system in the hands of the enemy.</p>

<p>T bays may be sited with due and careful
consideration while facing the enemy in an existing
trench system. Thus it gives you the advantage
of being able to take into consideration
all the requirements of the field of fire, control
of isolated areas, and the obtaining of
maximum results from enfilade fire. These T
trenches may be dug out from the old system
without undue exposure of your men and if
distance between the lines permits, and it is entirely
possible to construct a new and generally
more favorable line of trenches within 100
to 200 yards of the enemy’s trenches. Intervening
ground between these T bays must be
completely controlled by entanglements and mobile
machine guns, or automatic rifles, able to
operate from different alternating recesses in
the control trench. Fire platforms should be
placed in recesses at intervals in the control
trench from which covering fire can be given.
Artillery fire, to damage a T trench, must be
very accurate. In a traversed trench a shell
destroys not only lateral communication, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span>
the defenders as well, whereas with a T shape,
both fire-bays and control trench have to be
ranged and hit. The success of the enemy is
entirely local when capturing one of these T-bays,
and he may be shelled by your own artillery
without any danger or risks to those defending
their T-bays. Control trenches should
be dug first and zigzagged with the longer
stretches facing the enemy. This gives you another
fire-trench as well as a communication
trench, and is also ready for use at any time
needed before the T-bay is completed. On the
completion of the T-bay, the corners of the zigzagged
trench must be rounded off to make it
easier and quicker for the movement of troops
and carrying of stretchers.</p>

<div id="hdr_3" class="chapter">
<h2 id="DUGOUTS">DUGOUTS</h2>
</div>

<p>It is only under very exceptional circumstances
that under-cutting a trench wall is allowed,
and then the shelter should be cut in the
rear wall only. These shelters must be carefully
supervised and watched by the officer, as men
are very often careless, with the result that the
shelters are dug in a hurry and poorly. Then it
rains, the shelter falls in, and the men are no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span>
more. It should be high enough for a man to
sit up straight, and long enough for him to lie
down in, and deep enough for two men to lie
side by side. It should be raised at least a foot
above the floor level in the trench to prevent
water from the trench floor coming in. A shelter
smaller than these dimensions is useless.
It has a demoralizing effect, destroying all activity,
mental and physical. These shelters can<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span>
only be properly made by cutting into the rear
trench wall the necessary depth and length and
right to the top. Then, with any material which
is convenient, such as corrugated iron, brushwood,
old rubber sheets, revet the sides and
back. A corrugated iron roof is supported on
posts at a depth of about a foot to a foot and
a half below the normal level of the ground.
Then, when possible, cover this with rubber
sheets. If not possible to procure rubber
sheets, simply cover with dirt excavated from
shelter, taking care that it does not rise higher
than your parados.</p>

<div id="ip_21" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 38em;">
  <img src="images/i_020.png" width="600" height="444" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fire Trench, Showing Entrance to Shelter</span></p>

  <p>The shelter is of use only in a narrow or deep trench. Note
  that the floor is above the bottom of the trench.</p></div></div>

<p>A fire-trench, however, is not a proper place
for shelters, and they are generally better as a
weather protection than a shell-proof shelter.
Even this should not be favored too much, as it
tends to cause obstruction, delay and inconvenience
in the passing of troops. The real dugouts
for the accommodation of men holding a
line are generally behind the fire-trenches in
an immediate support line, or as in the case of
T-bays, in the control trench and communication
trenches leading to and from them. These
are large dugouts, having a depth of 30 and 40
feet, and in some cases capable of holding 100
to 250 men, generally having from 5 to 10 exits
and entrances. Here the men stay during bombardments<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span>
and are generally safe from any
caliber shell which may light on top, unless a
half dozen should light in the same particular
spot.</p>

<p>This work is generally of a very skilled and
technical kind. Plans, drawings and labor are
supervised by the engineers, expert tunnelers
being used in constructing work, although the
infantry supplies working parties to dispose of
the dirt, etc., resulting from these excavations
and to carry the materials and tools needed and
required in the construction.</p>

<p>The design and general scheme of a small
dugout which can be made by the infantry under
the supervision of an officer, without the aid
of an engineer, are here given. The dugout
should be approximately 6 feet from floor to
roof and about 8 feet wide, with an approximate
length of 12 feet, thus allowing men to lie down
and yet leave room for passage through. The
width depends upon the number you intend
to have occupy it. Each man requires 18″.
Depth to be dug below ground depends entirely
to what extent you may raise the roof upon the
ground without making an unduly exposed
hump which will at once tell the enemy a dugout
is there. The thickness of the roof should
be approximately 6 feet, constructed with side<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span>
posts, cross beams, corrugated iron, waterproof
oilcloth, sandbags and soil. Sandbag revetments
should be used in the strengthening of
side posts. When possible, although hardly
ever so, walls should be lined with waterproof
oilcloth and entrances so placed that they get as
much sun as possible.</p>

  <div class="caption"><p><i><span class="smcap">Dug-out with Roof Removed.</span></i></p>

<p>Dimensions variable. Note the wide berms permitting the use
of strong roof supports. A layer of large stones to cause
early shell burst should form part of the roofing.</p></div></div>

<p>Great care and attention must be given to
these dugouts, and even though taking a little
longer than seems necessary, care must be taken
to see that they are substantially constructed,
otherwise they are in a constant source of danger
of cave-ins during heavy shelling and bad<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span>
weather. Not more than 10 men should occupy
one of these dugouts. Then, if accidents happen,
your casualties are not so great.</p>

<p>The roof of these dugouts should be prepared
in a manner tending to withstand as high shell
shock as possible, and for this purpose the following
table would be of some use, any part of
which, or a combination of all, will give some
idea of what is required.</p>

<p>(a) Shrapnel bullets—Stout planks suitably
supported and covered with corrugated iron and

<p>(b) Ordinary guns of 3″ caliber—Strong timber

It is very often the case that there is a line
of trenches with very few dugouts. Those that
exist are mainly occupied by first aid stations
with a medical officer in charge, and officers’
headquarters. When such is the case, very
narrow, deep trenches, known as retirement
trenches, are dug roughly from 20 to 50 yards
behind the firing line, so that every one, except
those on sentry duty, may retire there during
the heavy shelling. It is very obvious that excellent
communication must be kept up between
this trench and the firing line.</p>

<h2 id="DUMPS">DUMPS</h2>
</div>

<p>Sandbags, corrugated iron, floor boards, ladders,
pails, brushes, rubber boots, periscopes,
barbed wire, etc., are what are known as
“trench stores.” These are generally brought
up by carrying parties during the night and
taken to some convenient spot picked out by
whosoever may be commanding that particular
section of trench, ready for distribution in the
morning. This place is known as a “trench
dump.” Here every morning each junior officer
goes to his company commander with a request
for his stores for the day. When this has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span>
been handed in and approved by his company
commander, he then has a party detailed to go
and collect his stores. These are again placed
in his particular little sector of the lines and he
receipts for their care and proper use; all stores
not used are turned over to the relieving troops
and a receipt taken for same. These dumps
must be made in a central location, both as regards
the company dump and the platoon. The
company dump is not a permanent home for the
stores or utensils brought up, but is merely
what might be called the distributing center.
When a company commander turns over his
trench stores and utensils to the relieving commander,
the fact that he has all his stores and
utensils in the company dump does not show
merit, but merely inefficiency, that the distribution,
which should have taken place, has not been
carried out, and, therefore, that some of the men
under his command probably have not the required
tools to work with or the material that
is necessary to the small units to carry on their
daily lives. Stores should not remain in their
center dumps. But each platoon commander
should know exactly how much he has in hand,
and how much he needs. It is also plainly evident
that in a scattering of dumps in this manner,
any captured by the enemy do not constitute<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span>
a “knock out” as far as the trench stores
are concerned.</p>

<hr />
<div id="hdr_6" class="chapter">
<h2 id="LATRINES">LATRINES</h2>
</div>

<p>The cleanliness of the trenches and latrines
requires the closest supervision of all officers
and non-commissioned officers. The bucket system
of latrines is entirely unsatisfactory. The
ground where the buckets are in use becomes
unsanitary, and so does the ground in which
the contents are buried. Double labor and carriage
is involved, and as often as not a polluted
soil is sooner or later to be found in the
line of a proposed communication trench. The
method used in the French armies is very good
and by far the cleanest. It involves no unpleasant
labor and is satisfactory. A pit about
12 feet deep, 3 feet wide and 12 feet long is dug
in some place which is fairly easy to get at by
those who are to use it. Generally thirty to
forty feet behind the fire-trenches and off one
of the communication trenches. The pit is
boarded over, the boards being laid across the
width, that is from front to rear; every other
board space being omitted. A pail of disinfectant
is kept standing nearby, and the deeper the
pit is, the better and longer it will remain in use,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span>
but should be filled in when contents are within
6 feet of the top. This makes subsequent unpleasantness
very unlikely. Care must be taken
that men using these places have some protection
from stray shells, and are out of sight of
the enemy.</p>

<p>When possible, there should be a refuse pail
for every section of men, and care should be
taken to impress on the men that they must
throw in all tea leaves, dregs, all scraps of food,
and refuse in general, and should be covered
over with disinfectant. If this is not done,
thousands of flies and insects are attracted, with
the inevitable rats, and disease and unsanitary
conditions will follow. Tin cans, etc., should
under no circumstances be thrown over the parapets
as the same results will occur there.</p>

<div id="hdr_7" class="chapter">
<h2 id="REVETMENTS">REVETMENTS</h2>
</div>

<p>When fire trenches are to be occupied for any
length of time it is necessary to revet them.
By that I mean the walls, and especially front
walls, have to be faced or strengthened by sand
bags, boards, corrugated iron or other material
that is needed. This work to be of any use at
all must have solid foundations and be thorough<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span>
from top to bottom. Careless revetment
work is of no use and a source of endless labor
and trouble. All such work should be supervised
by officers or N. C. O.’s who have a thorough
understanding of such things, and they
will be amply repaid if they take an active part
in the work with their own hands. There are
several forms of revetment, according to the
materials available and the conditions of the
walls to be revetted, but the usual materials are
the sandbags, corrugated iron, stakes, boards,
wire netting, etc., and these can be used either
separately or in a combination. All these materials
are generally kept in engineer dumps,
some little way behind the firing line. Requisitions
are made during the day by the officer
commanding the sector of trench which requires
revetting, and at night the men are detailed in
carrying parties to go down to the engineer
dumps and carry these things up for work the
next day.</p>

<p id="hdr_8" class="section"><span class="smcap">Sandbags.</span> Sandbags are usually available
in large quantities, but it is well to remember
that generally only half the number indented
for reach the indentor. The rest generally
go around the men’s feet and legs to
keep them warm at night, and very often are
used as a sort of mattress in the dugouts. This<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span>
should not be allowed as it creates a tremendous
wastage. The sandbags should only be about
three-quarters filled, thus allowing for the choke
or neck end, after tied, being turned under
the back when laid in position. This also gives
something to catch hold of when laying and
brings the weight to something manageable,
about sixty pounds. A bag three-quarters filled
measures approximately 20″ x 10″ x 5″. Laid
sand bags are called headers, when laid with
bottom of the bag facing the center of the
trench, and stretchers, if laid with the side facing
the trench as per sketch. The neck end
should always be tucked well in the bag in the
case of the stretcher; the side seam, which is
a weak spot in the sandbag, should be kept
from exposure, that is, should be turned from
the center of the trench.</p>

<p>When the front wall of a trench is to be
revetted and only sandbags are available, the
wall should first be cut to a slope of from 10
to 15 degrees from the perpendicular, and the
loose soil obtained, if dry, placed in the sandbags.
When there is an unrevetted fire platform,
this should be also cut away and put, if
dry, in the sand bags. A bed should then be dug
about 6 inches into the solid bottom of the
trench (disregarding the soft mud which for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span>
foundation purposes is of no use) and sloping
down into the parapet at right angles to the
slope of the front wall. Into this bed place
a row of headers. On this row place a double
row of stretchers. Joints must always be the
same manner as brick-laying; that is, care taken
that the joint where the ends of the stretchers
meet does not come immediately over the joint
between the headers and the lower row. Sand
bags should now be beaten down flat, generally
with a wooden mallet provided for this purpose;
then alternate rows of headers and
stretchers laid; each layer being flattened out
with the mallet until the top of the parapet is
reached. The top layer should always come out
as headers.</p>

<div id="ip_31" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 38em;">
  <img src="images/i_031.png" width="600" height="230" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">Headers,<br />Stretchers,<br />Headers</div></div>

<p>Twenty-five headers or twelve stretchers, or
sixteen mixed, is the average required for revetting
every superficial yard of trench.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span>
The slope of a front trench wall, even when
from 10 to 15 degrees from perpendicular, is
apt gradually to assume the perpendicular, and
then fall in, owing to the sinking of the trench
bottom or the actual thrust of the earth in front.
This can, however, be checked by using 6´ to 8´
stakes driven well into the front wall foundation,
and at the same angle as the front wall.
Then, wiring the head of these stakes to what
is known as an anchor-stake driven about 10´
into the ground in front of the trench.</p>

<p>Sandbags come in bales of 250, which are
again divided into bundles of 50 each. On a
carrying party it is an average rule that each
man carry 100 sand bags.</p>

<p id="hdr_9" class="section"><span class="smcap">Corrugated Iron.</span> Generally, when lengths
of corrugated iron and plenty of floor boards
and stakes are available, this material is used
for revetting the lower half of a trench wall, as
it removes a great many difficulties, such as
looking over substantial foundations for sandbag
revetments. It makes it unnecessary to fill
sandbags, etc., thus saving a great amount of
time and labor. In revetting with corrugated
iron and stakes or hurdles, cut the slope or wall
from 10 to 15 degrees from the perpendicular,
putting the soil in the sandbags and leaving it
in some handy place for any future use. Then,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span>
drive 6´ to 8´ stakes well into the trench foundation
and approximately 4´ apart, thus giving
adequate protection to each piece of corrugated,
having the stakes at an angle of 15 degrees at
least, from the perpendicular, and 6″ or 8″ away
from the trench wall. Then, slide the corrugated,
hurdles, or boards on their sides down
behind the stakes, overlapping slightly the ends
and ramming them well down into the mud or
soil in the bottom, and filling in the space behind
with soil.</p>

<p>The bottom third or half of the front wall is
thus substantially, easily and quickly revetted,
and the upper half or remainder is generally
revetted with the sandbags, a bed being dug so
that the first layer of headers is about half its
depth below the top of the corrugated. If
stakes shorter than 6´ or 8´ have been used in
the revetting, half should be cut off to where
the sandbag revetting commences and wired to
anchor stakes, driven into the parapet end of
the bed, and not wired over the top of the parapet,
as it tends to gradually pull them upwards.
Then cover this wiring with your first layer of
headers. When hurdles or floorboards are used
instead of corrugated iron, empty sandbags or
similar material must be hung behind them to
prevent the soil crumbling through and thus<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span>
weakening the foundation of the sandbag revetments.
Corrugated should not be used for
revetting the front wall higher than 2´, which is
the width of one sheet, as the supply is generally
limited and can be put to more valuable
use as dealt with later.</p>

<p>Corrugated iron comes in bundles of about 24
sheets to the bundle, averaging 6´ by 3´. Two
sheets is the average load for any one man in
a carrying party.</p>

<p>A front wall constructed in the manner
shown, if prompt and immediate attention always
be given to repair if damage is done, will
give very little bother. It is the usual custom
to construct your fire platform after this
revetting work has been done.</p>

<p>A trench should be dug no deeper than will
afford protection to the firer, a deeper passageway
necessitating a fire platform, a subsequent
work, and by first revetting the whole front
wall from bottom to top then adding the fire
platform, each gets the benefit of the foundation
of the other. Until this fire platform is constructed,
emergency methods may be used and
improvised in a moment with ammunition boxes,
loose sandbags and the various other junk which
accumulates in a trench.</p>

<p id="hdr_10" class="section"><span class="smcap">Fire Platforms.</span> Now that the front wall<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span>
has been revetted, either with corrugated or
sandbags, the construction of the fire platform
should be at once started. To start this,
short stakes should be driven well into the
trench bottom about 36″ from the front wall and
parallel to the slope of the front wall, averaging
from 2´ to 3´ apart and generally as substantial
as the large revetment stakes, although this is
not of absolute necessity.</p>

<p>When brushwood is procurable, it should be
used as a foundation, putting it in after the
short stakes are driven and ramming it down
behind them. This gives you as nearly as possible
a dry and compact foundation for your first
row of headers. Then this may be covered with
another lot of brushwood, and that again by a
row of headers, and from then the layer should
be alternate headers and stretchers. Sand bags
do not offer a good platform after a heavy rain,
as they become wet and slippery and the material
quickly rots, then they break open and the
top of your fire platform is gone. To avoid
this, it is necessary to use whatever material
may be at hand in the covering of the top
layer.</p>

<p>One good way of providing this top covering
when the material is procurable, is a wire netting
used in a double thickness. It should be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span>
placed behind and up against the stakes before
the foundation is laid. Then when the fire platform
is built to its proper height, bend the wire
from the top of the fire platform and fasten it
down on the sides by whatever means are
handy. Using this double wire netting makes
it possible to use brick and all sorts of general
trash in the construction of the fire platform
and gives a very good dry footing. When doing
that the face of your platform should be either
corrugated sheets or boards.</p>

<p>Very often what are known as sentry-boards,
or small floor boards about 36″ square and with
additional cross pieces underneath, giving them
a height of about a foot, thus raising them well
out of the mud, are used, and are very handy
before a fire platform is made, and in some
cases have to be used for small men after the
fire platform is made.</p>

<hr />
<div id="hdr_11" class="chapter">
<h2 id="TRAVERSES">TRAVERSES</h2>
</div>

<p>All the walls of the traverses must also be
revetted, generally with the sandbags and in
exactly the same manner as the front walls of a
fire-bay, care being taken to keep it well sloped.
This leads to a lessening of protection afforded<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span>
the occupants by making a greater width at the
top of the trench, but it is absolutely necessary
unless you wish your whole traverse to gradually
fall in, when you are in a position of having
no protection at all. The top of the traverse
may be and is often several feet higher than the
parapet, if the fire-bay it protects is exposed to
enfilade fire from the enemy trench at a higher
level. But when this is not the case, the traverse
should not be higher than the parapet or
parados, and should slope down towards the
enemy to give the appearance of being merely
a continuation of the parapet.</p>

<p>The traverse should never be less than 9´
wide, allowing 2´ for a sentry box, although this
sentry box is no longer generally in use.</p>

<p>What are known as overhead traverses are
made generally in a communication trench leading
up to the front line, and which in certain
parts the enemy are able to look into. These
overhead traverses give to this particular place
the protection which is necessary. They are
quickly and easily made by placing corrugated
iron, logs or strong branches, or floor boards,
across the top of the trench and putting sand
bags on the top of these. When the trench walls
are weak, or even on general principles, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span>
sides supporting this overhead traverse should
be revetted with sandbags.</p>

<p>The sentry boxes, although not in general
use now, are described, more for general information
than anything else. They are dug or
recessed in the traverse at either end of the
fire-bay and must have an observation slit in
the parapet for use by day, but no loophole
facing the enemy, as regardless of the care and
caution used in the construction of these loopholes,
they will sooner or later, generally
sooner, be observed by the enemy and the
sentry box made useless.</p>

<p>During an attack this sentry box is never
used, except for stores or the placing of
wounded, as there will always be plenty of room
for the late occupant in the fire-bay itself.
Sometimes, when energy and time permit, an
enfilade fire loophole is made through the traverse
and facing the next fire-bay, but this has
as much value for making easy verbal communication
from one fire-bay to another as it has to
the checking of attacking forces.</p>

<hr />
<div id="hdr_12" class="chapter">
<h2 id="LISTENING_POSTS">LISTENING POSTS</h2>
</div>

<p>As before mentioned, in the space between
the front lines of the opposing armies, which is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span>
known as No Man’s Land, there are sometimes
large and sometimes small areas of ground,
ditches, streams, etc., which cannot be satisfactorily
watched from a fire trench immediately
facing them, owing to the lay of the land,
hedges, old excavations, buildings, etc. This is
the case in a great many instances regardless
of the careful thought and the amount of time
spent in siting a fire-trench, as the siting of all
trenches is largely subsidized by the tactical
position of the flank trenches. Very often a
line of trenches is taken up under stress of circumstances
that do not permit of the obeying
of the rules and standards set for an ideal fire-trench.</p>

<p>The control of these areas is essential to prevent
small surprise attacks, cutting-out parties
and raids. During the day they are very often
observable from a flank trench or higher observation
ground in the rear, but at night this is
not possible; so that listening or observation
posts are gradually sited in front of the fire
trench with due consideration to the situation
in that immediate vicinity. A ruined shed,
shack, cart, or any other thing of a similar character
lying in No Man’s Land is very useful for
these purposes if it can be reached before the
enemy reach it with the same purpose in mind.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span>
This cannot be used very long, as its purpose is
too obvious and peace and quietness will not
last long, but it will do until a more satisfactory
arrangement can be made.</p>

<p>The listening post is often dug just inside the
outer fringe of your own barbed wire entanglements,
and is just large enough to allow two
men to stand in unobserved. It should be
reached by a very narrow, irregular trench
running out from a fire-bay, where it is fairly
easy to secure the maximum amount of concealment
necessary to give protection. The soil
excavated from these places must not be thrown
out, but placed in sand bags and taken into the
trench and used there. It is always best and
requires very little more labor, and gives the
maximum amount of protection to your listening
post if communication to it be made through
a tunnel.</p>

<p>These things are bound to be discovered
within a certain amount of time, and when you
know the position of your listening post has
been found by the enemy, which you will know
very quickly, owing to the amount of bombs and
rifle fire it will receive for one or two nights,
until you can dig another one, it is a safe
thing to build up a small parapet, taking it
down every morning before dawn. It then becomes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span>
necessary to dig a new post, and this can
be generally done by leading off from your old
communication trench to some more favorable
spot. When the new post is ready for occupancy,
the old one should be filled in with barbed
wire, or completely filled in again with dirt, and
the sandbag parapet left to mislead as long as
possible.</p>

<p>The first duty of a listening post is to listen
and report. Most of the work is done at night,
and no firing or sniping must be allowed from
it during the day. Patrols generally come out
via one listening post and return by another,
so that all listening posts must be warned of
the trench by which the patrol will come out and
the approximate hour of departure and return.
Patrols should never be sent out without definite
orders as to what is required, and especially as
to the listening post they leave and return by.
Listening posts should fire without challenge at
any one who approaches within sight, whether
friend or enemy, unless it has been warned that
a friendly patrol is out, in which event signals
should be pre-arranged. Then the listening
post will use the greatest caution and should
challenge audibly when the patrol is close, and
unless immediately satisfied, fire. Listening
posts are connected with the fire trench by a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span>
cord or wire, and a simple code of tugs is arranged,
or a bell fastened to the fire trench end
for alarm in case of emergency, and here a sentry
always stands to get any signals that may
come from the listening post.</p>

<p>If a listening post has not been warned that a
friendly patrol is out and fires on it without
challenge, the L. P. is absolved from all blame.</p>

<p>When a hedge or ditch, which might easily
provide cover to the enemy, is running parallel
with the firing trench, it must be controlled at
night by a machine or Lewis gun which is able
to enfilade a frontal advance over open ground
leading to it. If, as is often the case, the parallel
hedge or ditch is easily approached along
either hedges or ditches running at right angles
to it, these angles must be protected by machine
or Lewis gun firing down them.</p>

<p>When hedges or ditches running at right angles
from the firing line and leading towards the
enemy are in a sector of line, they should be protected
from dusk to dawn by one or two men,
generally only armed with bombs to protect
against surprise, and great care must be taken
that no more signs than possible are left to the
occupancy of this position over night.</p>

<h2 id="OBSERVATION_POSTS">OBSERVATION POSTS</h2>
</div>

<p id="hdr_14" class="section"><span class="smcap">Loopholes for Firing.</span> During an attack,
firing is never possible through loopholes as it
is too restricted to be of any value. All the
firing then is done over the parapet. The difficulty
of constructing new observation posts
which are effectual and inconspicuous for any
length of time has resulted in their not being
made in a parapet, where, when located by the
enemy, they are as often as not a source of danger.
Moreover, promiscuous firing through
loopholes by inefficient riflemen is of no value.
Sniping is under the control and supervision of
a sniping officer, and loopholes should only be
used by men appointed by that officer. They
are not used at night and should be only used
during the day for enfilade fire, and be placed
in the parapet as low down as is consistent with
line of site. A piece of cloth or empty sandbag
should be hung from the rear of the loophole, so
that when the hole is not obstructed by the fire,
no light can show through. No shots should be
fired from those loopholes, except at a definite
target, and ranges of targets or spots where
targets may possibly appear, should be ascertained
in advance, and necessary exposed movement,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span>
such as withdrawal of rifle, must be very
slow and gradual. With care, and when only
used by a skilled rifleman, a loophole will be of
value for probably two weeks and good results
obtained, but by a careless man the value of a
loophole will not last a day and very likely result
in casualties not only to the man shooting,
but to others as well.</p>

<p>In the area from 20 to 100 yards behind the
fire trench, there sometimes is, although very
seldom, ground much higher than the actual fire
trench, so that it is safe to allow even hastily
trained men to use it for firing over the heads
of the main front line trench, although it has
happened that men in such a position have fired
into their front line, thinking it the enemy line.
This ground is generally used by building what
are known as covering fire trenches. These to
be of any value, should not be more than 20
yards behind the front line, as farther forward
than 20 yards they become affected by artillery
fire directed at the fire trenches; and farther
back than 100 yards the covering fire, unless in
the hands of very skilled and efficient riflemen,
becomes very dangerous to the men in the front
line.</p>

<h2 id="SUPPORT_TRENCHES_AND_SUPPORT">SUPPORT TRENCHES AND SUPPORT
DUGOUTS</h2>
</div>

<p>A support trench is usually within 30 to 300
yards of a fire trench, and may serve the purposes
of covering fire trenches by skilled riflemen
or an indirect machine gun fire, but their
main purpose is to shelter troops from observation
and shell fire, and thus their main characteristics
become the size and strength of ample
dugouts. Troops in the support dugouts
are at hand for three purposes: Firstly, replacing
of casualties occurring in the fire
trenches during normal times or a hostile attack.
Secondly, holding the support trenches
in case the fire trenches are taken by the enemy.
Thirdly, in the event of an attack on the enemy’s
trenches, leading the attack by moving
forward over the heads of the occupants of the
fire trench, or if the latter are leading the attack,
to occupy at once the fire trench when
vacated. For this reason it is of vast importance
that there are accessible and commodious
support dugouts and communications between
the immediate support trenches and front
line. If this is so there will be less chance of
disasters to supports and reserves coming up<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span>
to make good a successful attack. There must
be support dugouts even in the event of there
being no support trenches, and this is very often
possible owing to the lay of the land. The
strength and size of these dugouts entirely depend
on tactical considerations and local conditions,
which are generally decided by the
staff.</p>

<hr />
<div id="hdr_16" class="chapter">
<h2 id="SUPPORT_POINTS">SUPPORT POINTS</h2>
</div>

<p>These forts or strong points, as they are
sometimes called, usually round or square, but
which may be any shape best suited to the condition
of the country in which they are placed,
are generally from 100 to 300 yards behind the
fire-trenches and supplementary to the support
trenches. Each of these strong points contains
a permanent garrison of firing troops, strongly
protected with barbed wiring and sandbag revetments,
and well supplied with ammunition,
food and water, to enable them to withstand
heavy attacks. During an attack they are used
to give overhead covering fire, and for the control
of ammunition and other supplies to be
sent on to the firing line. It is a general rule
that if the enemy take a fire line the garrison
of these supporting points must hold out and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span>
remain a thorn in the enemy’s side until the
last man of the garrison is killed.</p>

<hr />
<div id="hdr_17" class="chapter">
<h2 id="RESERVE_DUGOUTS">RESERVE DUGOUTS</h2>
</div>

<p>These dugouts protect the local reserves from
which supports are supplied and are used for
purposes similar to those for which the immediate
support dugouts are employed, but on
a great deal larger scale. These dugouts are
generally near battalion headquarters and from
500 to 1,500 yards behind the firing line. The
chief considerations in siting the positions of
these dugouts are three: First: facilities for
rapid and easy transit to the support and fire-trenches;
second: concealment; third: comfort.
Comfort should be secondary to the other conditions
affecting the siting of the system.</p>

<hr />
<div id="hdr_18" class="chapter">
<h2 id="SECOND_LINE">SECOND LINE</h2>
</div>

<p>This comprises the line of fire-trenches, with
covering fire-trenches, support trenches, support
dugouts and reserve dugouts (in other
words, it is an exact duplication of the front
line system), far enough behind the front line<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span>
that in the event of the first system being taken,
the second line is ready to be taken up by the
troops driven out of the front line, and receive
the support of troops lying in brigade or divisional
reserve. The distance of the second line
behind the first is roughly a mile, and while the
first line is held, operations of the second often
provide useful accommodation for the machine
guns and artillery, both for firing purposes,
observation and shelter.</p>

<p>The time available for siting and constructing
second line system, and the freedom from all
disturbances which bother the front line system,
should result in its being impregnable. It
is an ideal system provided those responsible
for its siting and construction are thoroughly
and practically experienced with first line conditions
and profit by that experience and former
mistakes.</p>

<hr />
<div id="hdr_19" class="chapter">
<h2 id="COMMUNICATION_TRENCHES">COMMUNICATION TRENCHES</h2>
</div>

<p>When siting communication trenches, two
considerations come into conflict with one another;
the desire for protection, and the necessity
of rapid and easy transit. It is obvious
that a C. T. is of vital importance to the firing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span>
line in the getting up of supporting troops, ammunition
and stores rapidly and without undue
fatigue. It is also obvious that it must give as
much protection as possible to the troops using
the C. T., but it must be recognized that the
protection given must not interfere with rapid
transit by making the C. T. too narrow. It must
also be kept in mind that rapid transit in itself
gives a certain amount of protection for the
simple reason that the easier and quicker the
transit, the less time are troops delayed in the
C. T.’s in which protection is required, and if
troops can cover the danger area in 10 minutes,
they are plainly in danger for a less period
than if it took 30 minutes to struggle over that
same area. This rapid transit, only obtained
by a dangerously wide communication trench
from support or reserve lines and from dugouts,
also makes it possible for less troops to be
regularly on duty in the fire-trenches, which are
always uncomfortable and dangerous, especially
during a bombardment, and it also enables supports
and reserves to be rushed up quickly when
the occasion demands.</p>

<p>It can be plainly seen now that a compromise
must be effected between claims of protection
and rapid transit, so that the size and shape of
the C. T.’s will vary according to their distance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span>
from a danger area. Generally speaking, the
nearer to danger, the more must the claims of
rapid transit give way to those of protection.</p>

<p>Disregarding for the time being the claims of
protection and only considering rapid transit,
there are these things to be considered: First,
that a C. T. be as short as possible, making use
of contours, sunken roads and other natural
features to avoid digging as much as possible.
Second, that a C. T. be as straight as possible,
which not only shortens the distance but avoids
turns and corners which interfere with speed
and which require renewed effort at every turn.
These sharp corners and turns must always
be avoided. This can be done without weakening
a trench or increasing the risk, and every
effort should be made to save troops carrying
full equipment, stores, ammunition, or rations
from unnecessary tiring, hindrances, and difficulties,
such as sharp corners and turns. Third,
the C. T. J.’s must be as level as possible, as
they are generally slippery, and inclines or declines
should be avoided as they very often
cause accidents. A longer C. T. following
around natural contours is frequently more advantageous
for this reason than a straight one
over a hill, which it is only possible to make
level by an amount of digging out of proportion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span>
to the result gained. The C. T. must be wide
enough for requirements. These differ according
(a) to the proximity of C. T. to the fire-trenches,
(b) to the number of C. T.’s available,
and (c) to the use for which a C. T. is required,
i. e., whether a double C. T. (for both up and
down traffic) or a single C. T. (for traffic in one
direction only).</p>

<p>When a C. T. is close to the fire-trench, troops
moving into it are practically themselves in the
fire-trench and as each group has probably to
get to a different part of that fire-trench, all
necessary traffic up and down the fire-trench
and disturbance of the men occupying it must
be avoided. Rapid transit can advantageously
be obtained by other means than the width of
the C. T.; by dividing the single C. T. at some
point from 30 to 60 yards in rear of the actual
fire-trench into a number of small narrow C.
T.’s, each leading to a group of 3 to 6 fire-bays,
and these may again be divided into those for
up and those for down traffic.</p>

<p>This system requires a fair amount of thinking
out and all the trenches should be plainly
marked and named. These names are placed
on notice boards at the different junctions having
the proper indications and rules directing
the use of up and down traffic. This is and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span>
should be rigidly enforced during both quiet
and active periods, but takes on a much greater
importance during active periods.</p>

<p>The width of these single C. T.’s running
close to the fire-trenches should be enough to
allow a man carrying full equipment, stores, or
rations to pass along easily and without bumping
the sides with his equipment or burden; approximately
two feet at the bottom with ample
room at all corners. The width of a single C. T.
for down traffic only should be wide enough to
allow for passage of a laden stretcher, especially
at the corners, as a stretcher is a very
clumsy thing to get around these corners and
often the delay caused has very serious consequences.</p>

<p>As a C. T. leaving a fire-trench gets farther
away, the width should be as soon as possible
such as will allow two men to pass one another
fully equipped without jostling or scraping the
sides of the trench, or approximately 4 ft. at the
bottom. This width with recesses described
later allows rapid transit for troops passing
each other in quiet parties and allowing a much
greater safety in an emergency when there is
no down traffic.</p>

<p>The front is always referred to as “up.”</p>

<p>Another advantage to be gained in the width<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span>
of the C. T. is in the fact that it is much easier
to keep dry and usable. It permits laying of
regulation floor boards, allowing enough room
on each side of them for the purpose of drainage,
and is a means of preventing falling soil
from covering the floor boards. Water will not
drain off or through soil which is continually
trampled on and has become sodden or irregular,
and unless the floor boards are kept free
from soil, they soon become useless, crooked
and immovable. The width of these trenches
allows the wind and sun to reach the bottom of
the trench, thus helping a great deal in keeping
it dry. There is no such thing as a communication
trench 18 inches wide at the bottom and
24 inches wide at the top; diggings of these dimensions
are nothing more than drains which in
an emergency only are struggled through when
passing in the open is still more impossible, and
they should not be given any consideration
whatever as a C. T.</p>

<p>The features required in a communication
trench, regardless of the claims of rapid transit
and only considering protection, are:</p>

<p>(First) Frequent traverses or turnings to
avoid the effect of enfilade fire, to localize the
effect of a bursting shell or bomb, to make difficult
a hostile advance down the C. T. and to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span>
enable bomb parties to resist more easily their
advance.</p>

<p>(Second) A trench that is sufficiently narrow
will localize the effect of a bursting shell
or bomb and minimize the effectiveness of hostile
fire, which must have a high degree of accuracy
to be effective. But the quicker over
the ground the shorter the period of danger,
and shell fire of any degree of accuracy will
substantially narrow one of these narrower
trenches, damaging the walls and causing casualties
and other obstructions which will render
passage impossible with either one or two results.
Delay caused at a critical moment, or
the occupants trying to obtain a passage up the
trench in order to take any part in the fighting,
would have to come out into the open sooner
than necessary. The shelling of the C. T.’s usually
is heavier for perfectly obvious reasons
during an attack and when rapid transit
through them is of the utmost importance. A
narrow trench generally takes as long to dig
as one of the wider type, owing to the restricted
area in which to work.</p>

<p>(Third) If invisibility be possible, it is an
excellent feature, but in nine hundred and
ninety-nine cases out of a thousand it is hardly
possible. An observed C. T. indicates the position<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span>
and direction of supports, stores, reserves,
dugouts, etc. This fault can be corrected
to a certain extent by the careful use of the
contours, dead ground, sunken roads, and all
natural features, such as woods and hedges.
Artificial cover may and does assist concealment,
but sooner or later hostile aerial observation
and photographs disclose the position of
more easily concealed things than an excavated
C. T. It is frequently the shadow at the bottom
of a trench which gives its position away to
aircraft, and the narrower the trench, the more
prominent is the shadow. The soil, which is
generally a different color from the surface soil,
must be thrown up on either side as time does
not allow it being carried away. Unless in a
place of artificial cover through the length of
the C. T., it is usually necessary to admit the
impossibility of concealment and utilize time
more profitably by taking protective measures.</p>

<p>Rapid transit to a fire-trench is of greater
importance than rapid transit from a fire-trench,
and the importance of protection is
greater as the fire-trench and its dangers are
approached. Methods of construction should
be based on this idea and the arguments given
above.</p>

<h2 id="SKETCH_OF_TRENCH_SYSTEM">SKETCH OF TRENCH SYSTEM</h2>
</div>

<p>This sketch shows a double-traffic communication
trench leading (5 ft. wide) from reserves
and H. Q. to a loopholed island-traverse about
30 yards behind the support line. At this
island-traverse, single-traffic C. T. branches off
to various sectors of the support line; the main
C. T. leading on (from 3 to 4 feet wide) uninterrupted
through the support line to loopholed
island-traverse “E,” about 30 yards behind the
firing line. At this island-traverse the main
C. T. breaks off into single-traffic C. T. 3 feet
wide. Each leads to various sectors of the firing
line.</p>

<p id="hdr_21" class="section"><span class="smcap">Section I.</span> C. T. should start behind one of
the fire-trench traverses and not from a fire-bay.
Every yard should be contestable for approximately
the first 15 to 20 yards. This can
be effected, and at the same time the effect
of hostile artillery and rifle fire and bombs
localized, by a series of traverses 9 feet
square, the trench being approximately 7 feet
deep and 2 feet wide at the bottom. Cut into
the rear of a few of these traverses is a narrow
recess through which one of the defending
bombing party may take up a position in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span>
center of the traverse and fire, kneeling or
standing, through a loophole at the advancing
enemy. The recess gives him ample protection,
including head cover, and is so cut that the entrance
is out of alignment with the trench behind
him and he will be unaffected by a bomb
exploding there. At the same time he may
work with, and direct, the bombers behind him
who are bombing over the traverse, and if it
becomes necessary, they can also take cover in
the entrance to the recess. The loophole should
not be placed so high that it becomes possible
for the enemy to come forward under it.</p>

<p>The most dutiable arms for the members of
the defending bombing party detailed for this
traverse work are what are known as “close-contact
weapons,” generally including revolvers,
bombs, trench knives, and very often a
bayonet carried by pushing it down in the
puttee.</p>

<p>SKETCH OF TRENCH SYSTEM</p></div></div>

<p id="hdr_22" class="section"><span class="smcap">Section II.</span> The time and claims of rapid
transit will not allow the traverse system as employed
in Section I to be continued, the narrow
single-traffic C. T.’s, from wear and tear and
shell fire, soon become wider, and as the width
would allow rapid transit to friend and foe
alike, it is of the utmost importance that some
means be adopted to deprive the enemy of this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span>
advantage. Moreover, the enemy may have
successfully advanced down on traversed C. T.,
say, at “C,” and our own bombers might still
be fighting in another traversed C. T., say, at
“D,” and their needs demand protection. This
may be obtained if, before the single C. T.’s
merge into the double, each of them be quite
straight for approximately 15 yards, and island-traverse,
“E,” be placed at the junction. In
the rear of this island, “E,” is a large and substantial
recess, into which one or two Lewis
guns or automatic rifles can be placed, firing
through loopholes and rendering hostile advance
down both “C” and “D” communication
trenches almost impossible. The recess in “E”
must allow ample room in which to operate.
Overhead cover is provided, and one rifle would
require one long loophole, so that it could fire
along either C. T. without more than a moment’s
interruption. In the case of two rifles
being available, there could be two such long
loopholes, each covering both C. T.’s, one for
kneeling and one for standing. The lower loophole
gives the advantage of it being impossible
for any of the enemy to get out of danger beneath
it. The fact that the traverse is an island
one, with passageway either side, would allow
friends to advance round the traverse and up<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span>
“D” to the support of friends still fighting
there, and without obstructing the fire directed
from the traverse at enemy advancing down
“C.”</p>

  <div class="caption"><p><i>ISLAND TRAVERSE</i></p>

<p>A type used to control long, straight stretches of trench.</p></div></div>

<p>An island-traverse so constructed and
manned should be unapproachable along either
trench “C” or “D,” but precautions must be
taken to prevent the enemy avoiding it by coming
out into the open, as in active moments C.
T.’s become as mutilated as fire trenches and
the enemy may leave the C. T. before reaching
the 15-yard stretch and approach the traverse
from above or flank. In anticipation of this,
the position “H” is selected slightly in rear and
to flank of the traverse, and in this position one
of the automatic rifles may take up, either originally
or by retirement from “E,” and deliver
the required traversing covering fire across the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span>
front of “E” and giving adequate protection
to the garrison manning the island-traverse.
Barbed wire is also generally placed in open
ground such as this described, say, for instance,
between “K” or “L” on either side of the 15-yard
stretches to impede hostile exit and advance.
The overhead traverse just in front of
the island gives protection against bombs
thrown down on C. T.</p>

<p>When covering fire is not required, the position
“H” will form an alternative position
should the island-traverse be destroyed by shell
fire or taken by the enemy; but the latter will
be of little use to the enemy as their progress
passed it is blocked by a loophole placed at
“H” and covering the trench “M” down which
they must advance. It also covers a dummy
trench, shown as “N,” down which there is a
fair chance that the enemy would naturally go
if a misleading notice were placed at the junction
of “M” and “N.” The slight turn at the
end, “O,” will prevent premature knowledge
as to the real nature of this trench. The enemy’s
progress may also be blocked for a short
time by having rolls of looped wire, sometimes
known as concertina wire, so placed in recesses
in the side of the trench, and so arranged that
when a man retiring down a trench can catch<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span>
hold of the roll as he passes a recess, uncoils it
as he runs, leaving it in the trench in a badly
tangled mass.</p>

  <div class="caption"><p>Section III</p>

<p>SKETCH OF TRENCH SYSTEM</p></div></div>

<p id="hdr_23" class="section"><span class="smcap">Section III.</span> Supporting trenches may be at
any distance from 30 to 300 yards behind the
firing trenches. The C. T. in this section is constructed
on the same lines, or may be constructed
on the same lines, as Sections I and II,
into whatever proportions local conditions and
practical considerations, and particularly dangerous
places, may dictate. The zigzag plan
shown in the sketch is generally safe to adopt,
as it allows rapid transit with a certain amount
of concession to the claims of protection, more
so as it approaches the fire trenches. These
C. T.’s generally should be a series of straight
stretches, zigzagging at acute or obtuse angles,
the length and angles governed by local conditions,
the extent and direction from which each
stretch might be enfiladed, and the gradient and
distance from danger. It has been shown before
that the shorter the stretches and the more
acute the angle at the turn, the less is the danger
from enfilade fire, but the C. T. with this
advantage requires a greater length of time and
labor in digging, as well as taking a great deal
more time and effort to pass through it. In
order to lessen these things as much as possible,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span>
it is always considered best to adopt longer
stretches and more obtuse angles as soon as
possible.</p>

<p>The excavated soil is naturally thrown up on
the side facing the enemy, and thus forming a
parapet. It can at times be used as an actual
fire trench. The parapet should fulfill the same
conditions as the parapet of a fire trench, and
where necessary, overhead traverses should be
placed. The more of these overhead traverses
used, the longer can the straight run of trench
be. When running up-hill, facing the enemy, it
is clearly obvious that acute turns and short
stretches are necessary, or, if it is not found
advisable to use these and more time can be
gained by digging the straight runs, then they
should be dug deeper and a great deal of care
taken in placing the overhead traverses.</p>

<p>Generally, the farther the C. T. from the enemy,
the less necessity to take measures for
stopping hostile advance down it, but it is a safe
thing when time permits to loophole the traverses
facing the long straight stretches either
in an ordinary traverse or when time permits
the building of island-traverses, especially at
junctions. Such loopholes command the
straight stretch in front and are reached by
narrow trenches very similar to a drainage<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span>
trench, as indicated at “H.” Here again, as
well, the loopholes for at least one or two should
be for kneeling fire.</p>

<p>Hostile attacks may also be hampered here
by using the rolls of looped wire previously
mentioned, or by frames of barbed wire placed
at the side of the trench just behind the parapet,
so that a man retiring down the trench can
easily pull them down into the trench after him.
Great care must be taken that C. T.’s running
from firing line to support trenches do not obstruct
the fire from the supporting trenches.</p>

<p>SKETCH OF TRENCH SYSTEM</p></div></div>

<p id="hdr_24" class="section"><span class="smcap">Section IV.</span> Behind the support trenches the
C. T. should be constructed on the traverse principle
of <a href="#hdr_21"><i>Section I</i></a>, so that the same defensive
features existing for the support trenches as
should exist for the firing line. In doing this,
however, it should be kept in mind to provide
rapid transit for troops behind these supporting
lines. This is best done by continuing the
zigzag system right through support trenches
as shown. When necessary, this C. T. can be
blocked.</p>

<p>It is always a possibility that support
trenches may be lost, but not a probability.
Therefore, undue weight should not be given
against the convenience of adopting as soon as
possible again the zigzag C. T. of <a href="#hdr_22"><i>Section II</i></a>, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span>
latter supplying all requirements of rapid transit
and allowing the introduction of straight
stretches in loophole traverses wherever required.</p>

<hr />
<div id="hdr_25" class="chapter">
<h2 id="TELEPHONE_LINES">TELEPHONE LINES</h2>
</div>

<p>It is generally found that artillery telephone
lines are laid on the north and west side of a
C. T.; infantry lines on the south and east.
Lines are generally laid about two feet from the
bottom of the trench, picketed inter-grooves
being cut into the side of the trench. These
lines must be given absolutely every protection
possible by the infantry and by any one using
the trenches. Far too much carelessness has at
times existed which destroyed communication
with artillery and infantry when it was of vital
importance that it should be open.</p>

<p>Infantry in the trenches depend for immediate
support upon their artillery, and if, through
lack of supervision on the part of the officers
in charge, these lines are destroyed or temporarily
torn down by careless men not understanding
their significance and importance, then
that officer or officers is guilty of a very serious
crime.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span></p>

<div id="hdr_26" class="chapter">
<h2 id="RECESSES">RECESSES</h2>
</div>

<p>These are usually made in C. T. to allow for
the passing of troops or bearers of stretchers,
or parties passing up and down to the line carrying
the many things that are necessary for the
upkeep of that line.</p>

<p>It is advisable that these should always be
placed in the same corresponding place in each
stretch, as shown in <span class="smcap">Section</span> III, just before the
turn, so that men know where they are to be
found. The first man of a party coming up
having arrived at a turn, and seen or heard
others coming down, can give necessary protection
to his party, and a great deal of unnecessary
and very exasperating and fatiguing
movements, and sometimes retracing of steps, is
avoided. It is also often the cause of a great
many casualties in a trench where these recesses
are not made, as parties of men coming and going
very often, while struggling to get past one
another with their loads, are caught by heavy
shell fire.</p>

<p>The recesses should be about 8 feet long and
at least 2 feet wide, and the soil excavated from
these recesses could be used for strengthening
the parapets of the C. T.’s at these turns. Generally,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span>
when time allows and energy permits,
close to the firing line these recesses are made
longer and deeper, oftentimes running to 12
and 18 feet long by 6 and 10 feet deep, although
it is not advisable to crowd them too much.
Recesses of this kind may also be heavily roofed
and used as a very temporary shelter for
stretcher cases, stores of bombs, ammunition,
etc.</p>

<p>At every second or third stretch in these C.
T.’s, either steps or an easy runway to the top
of the trench should be made. This saves time
on a great many occasions when parties coming
over the top for speed and comfort find themselves
stopped and have to take to the trench
on short notice. It is also good when a serious
obstruction occurs, and it is necessary to leave
a C. T. and enter it again farther on.</p>

<hr />
<div id="hdr_27" class="chapter">
<h2 id="NOTICE_BOARDS">NOTICE BOARDS</h2>
</div>

<p>These boards should be fixed at every entrance
and junction in a trench system, stating
the name of the trench and the places to which
it leads, and where there are trenches expressly
for up and down traffic, these boards should
state it. Some people argue that such notices<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span>
assist the enemy when they get into our
trenches, but the argument does not hold as it is
very often the case they do not know the names
used in the sectors, as they vary up and down
the line, and generally they have a very good
idea of the system they will find themselves in
anyway, and there is a very small chance that a
majority of them will be able to read them
anyway.</p>

<p>Care must be taken that these notice boards
are not used for what is known as “boiling up,”
building fires, in braziers, etc., as the absence
of these boards causes a tremendous amount of
confusion when new troops are coming into the
line. All officers must know the shortest routes
from their own headquarters to those of companies
on their flanks, as well as their own battalion
headquarters, and every officer, N. C. O.
and man must know the position of his immediate
commander’s dugout, as well as his company
headquarters, and every man must know
the name of the trench that he is in and helping
to hold, and this is not possible when these
notice boards are destroyed.</p>

<p>Efforts at drainage, which is the greatest
trouble during the winter months to troops
occupying the line, must be as systematic and
thorough as possible. Tinkering is of very
little use and brings no results but causes a
great and tiring expenditure of labor as far as
the men are concerned, with no end of work in
sight. When taking over a sector of line, the
drainage system must be thoroughly studied
and a line of campaign mapped out and strictly
adhered to. Thorough work in the initial stages
will save any amount of subsequent unnecessary
fatigue and labor. The system to be applied
depends entirely on local conditions, but
full advantage must be taken of the assistance
which nature affords. Water running down
hill is a marvelous fact; nevertheless it is often
overlooked. Field drains and natural streams
anywhere near the trench must be kept clear of
obstructions. These are usually attended to by
the overworked farmers in peace times, but as
they do not work near a trench system, it must
be looked after by the army. Neglect of the
natural watercourses has been the cause of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span>
much of the difficulty of draining the trenches
themselves.</p>

<p>During the winter months a trench is never
really drained. A mixture in the trenches which
is neither water nor good, sticky mud, but a
beautiful liquid combination of water and dirt,
which is thick enough not to run, is formed.
Sometimes it becomes sufficiently like water to
be pushed or assisted to run down hill with
scrapers, boards, and anything else that is
handy. Sometimes it becomes sufficiently heavy
enough to be shoveled over the parapet or put
into sand bags. In either of these cases it is
only overcome by persistent labor, but when the
mud is in its true clayed self it is a waste of
time and labor to attempt to move it, and the
only way, without a large amount of cursing, is
to sit tight and pray for the sun to dry it.</p>

<p>When a valley or dip is close to the side of a
C. T. a few narrow gullies through the side, of
about 18 inches in width, should be made so that
liquid mud can be swept along the trench and
on through the gulley to a natural fall. These
little gullies or ditches should start at a place
or places where there are dips in the level of
the trench and must be dug straight through the
side, as it then becomes easier to keep clear and
gives no obstruction to the flow of mud; but if<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span>
facing the enemy, it should not be in a straight
line, as it then allows rifle fire into the trenches.
If no other way is possible, then overhead
traverse or other means of protection should
be taken at that point. Sometimes, when it is
not possible to complete these gullies, they
should be dug out as far as circumstances will
permit and a block of soil or very large sods
be put at the junction of the gulley to the trench
and the liquid mud dipped out of the trench
and dumped into the gulley, where it will be
prevented from running into the trench again
by these collections of sods. This process is
very slow, but conditions frequently make it the
easiest and most convenient way of ridding the
trenches of some of the mud. This work can be
carried on by what is sometimes known as a
“trench patrol” or maintenance squad, which
is generally detailed from the company in the
support line and which patrols the system of
trenches held by their battalion during the day.
The N. C. O. in charge generally reports serious
collapses to his company officer, who in turn
reports it to the engineers, who immediately
take steps to have it repaired.</p>

<p>The width of drainage gullies should not be
less than 18 inches, thus allowing easy use of
brushes issued. With these brushes and adequate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span>
gullies, very long stretches of trench can
be kept in excellent condition when the trench is
wide enough to allow the drying effect of wind
and sun to reach the bottom. The time spent
in making these gullies is saved over and over
again. If there be no natural valley or dip, a
sump-pit is generally dug, the size depending on
the energy of the troops digging it, but generally
it is about 10 feet below the level of the
trench it drains, and anything from 8 feet on
in diameter. It is dug some fair distance from
the trenches and in a position that will allow the
maximum amount of gullies to be led to it from
that particular section of the trench.</p>

<p>After having this system worked out, the next
thing is to ascertain what parts of the rest of
the trench system will not be affected by this
drainage, and there to dig similar sump-pits
just to the side of the trenches drained, small
gullies leading to them. These need only be
about 6 feet deep below the trench level and 4
feet in diameter. A short gulley, 12 to 15 inches
wide and 2 feet long, should lead from the trench
to the sump-pit, as shown in sketch of trench
system.</p>

<p>Sometimes the sump-pit may be semi-circular
and cut into the side of the trench, but in this
case some barrier must be put across it to prevent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span>
men falling in while traveling at night.
The former system is far more satisfactory, and
especially so when the trench is hardly wide
enough to allow the passing of traffic without
touching the sides of the trench.</p>

<p>Entrances to these sump-pits must always be
kept clear of all obstructions. Very often a
ridge of mud from a man’s foot-mark is enough
to put a sump-pit out of action. They should
be continually emptied by pumping the contents
over the parapet, or carrying in pails to the
nearest gulley.</p>

<p>The side sump-pits must never be cut under
the wall of a trench. On very short notice the
roof will take the place of the excavated soil
and there will be no sump-pit.</p>

<p>It is not always that pumps are available,
and the few of those which are, are of no practical
use for a length of time sufficient to be of
any value; in fact, they hardly repay the fatigue
entailed in getting them to the trenches.
For ordinary trench drainage several small
pumps are of far more use than one large one,
as the range’s limited by the difficulties of removing
it or by the length of pipe attached.
These pumps, whether large or small, must be
given a large and substantial platform, placed
in some central position among a number of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span>
sump-pits. Each pump must have not only a
discharge pipe, but a suction pipe, the latter being
movable from one pit to another in the
pump’s area without moving the pump. The
placing of these pumps must be thorough and
systematic, and those sump-pits not reached by
pumps must be kept empty by means of pails.</p>

<hr />
<div id="hdr_29" class="chapter">
<h2 id="FLOORBOARDS">FLOORBOARDS</h2>
</div>

<p>Although these are rarely available in sufficient
numbers to be laid continuously along the
entire length of the trench, it is unwise to throw
one down on a particularly muddy spot in a
trench as a remedy. The result is that when it
becomes covered with mud it sinks out of sight,
and another one is thrown down with the same
result. Then, when an attempt to drain is
made, much to somebody’s disgust they run
into a layer of floorboards, quit work, and the
trench never becomes drained. Patchy repairs
to a trench bottom are as aggravating and as
useless as bad revetment. When only a few
floorboards are available, then they should be
laid in one length and that length made as
nearly perfect as possible, until more may be
had, then that length continued. Patching here<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span>
and there is of no use and never leads anywhere.
Trench bottoms are treated in different
ways up and down the line, depending on
localities and materials on hand. In some places
the trench bottom is of concrete blocks and
bricks, with a small trench ditch of about 6
inches running along the side. This is not a
very happy combination, as men traveling up
and down the trenches at night with heavy loads
sometimes stumble, their feet go in, the trench
ditch becomes full of mud and blocked up, and
your trench gradually becomes flooded up
and down its length, unless very great care
is taken. Where time and labor are available,
long lengths of trench may be put and kept in
good condition and the trench question partially
solved if two rows of stout 4-foot sticks are
driven well into the bottom of the trench, about
3 feet apart. Wooden rails are then nailed
along the top of the stakes and cross-bars nailed
and fastened to the rails. This work must be
done thoroughly, though, or weak places will
occur and become very dangerous for men traveling
at night with heavy loads, as a fall
through a hole in one of these bottoms generally
means a broken ankle or some other accident.</p>

<p>In some parts of the line it has not been
necessary to use anything for a trench floor,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span>
the ground itself being sufficient, with a small
drainage ditch dug at the side, as in the case of
those trench bottoms covered with cement and
brick.</p>

<hr />
<div id="hdr_30" class="chapter">
<h2 id="BRUSHWOOD_AND_STRAW">BRUSHWOOD AND STRAW</h2>
</div>

<p>Brushwood should not be placed in a trench
bottom, except under very exceptional circumstances,
and, as a matter of fact, is very seldom
used, its value lying more in the manufacture
of hurdles. Once brushwood has been trodden
into the mud it is absolutely impossible to remove
it, and there is no means of removing the
mud and properly repairing the trench bottom.
Straw under no circumstances should ever be
put in a trench bottom, and when put into dugouts
or shelters, should be cleared out and
burned where possible (which will not be in
front line) as soon as it becomes sodden or sour.
The floor of the dugouts and shelters must be
thoroughly cleaned of all this old straw, sand
bags and bad soil before fresh straw is put in.
It is possible in large dugouts such as are found
in reserve and support lines, to make bunks out
of wire netting on the same style as the berth in
a steamer, and in a modern dugout enough of
these bunks may be made to accommodate a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span>
company. In all German dugouts this is the
practice, although it is not possible in close
proximity to the front line. Advantage must
be taken of what material is at hand.</p>

<hr />
<div id="hdr_31" class="chapter">
<h2 id="WORKING_PARTIES">WORKING PARTIES</h2>
</div>

<p>The routine of a battalion which is doing, for
the sake of illustration, we will say six days in
the trenches, is roughly as follows:</p>

<p>Six days are spent in what is generally known
as a Brigade Reserve, which means living in
the reserve dugouts or billets, depending on
the closeness of a village to the firing line. During
these six days the battalion supplies working
parties to assist the battalion holding the
line in the upkeep of its trenches. Very often
this necessitates continuous work night and day
for the men, more especially so during the winter
months. At the end of the six days they go
to the trenches and are in turn assisted by the
working parties of the battalion relieved.</p>

<p>These working parties may sometimes be actually
in the front line with the battalion that
relieved them, or on the communication trenches
leading to the front line, or on the second line
defenses or reserve and support dugouts. This
work is carried on under the supervision of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">81</span>
engineer officers generally acting under orders
from their brigade and divisional commanders.
A request is made daily through the battalion
commander for so many men to form the various
working parties for that day and night, and
the battalion commander keeping the brigade
or division informed of his actual strength,
protects his battalion from impossible allotments
of work. These working parties are then
detailed with the officer in charge, and he is
generally given sufficient notice that he may
have some idea of the task ahead of him. It
is then to that officer’s benefit, knowing the
amount of men who will have to do the task and
what the task is like, for him to study out before
leaving for the place where the work is to
be done, just exactly what he intends to do and
what sort of an organization it will require to
do the work with the least possible friction.</p>

<p>This is absolutely essential, as naturally men
coming from a six days’ tour of the trenches
and being ordered on a working task, are not
keen on the job, and when an officer has not
studied beforehand what he intends doing and
how it shall be done, it winds up in endless confusion,
disgusts the men more than ever, and
precious little work is done.</p>

<p id="hdr_32" class="section"><span class="smcap">Reliefs.</span> The total time occupied in digging<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span>
trenches is generally divided into parties called
reliefs, usually of four hours. Shorter periods
than this means much time wasted in commencing
work and in delays; but, as a matter of
fact, the time spent on the job and going to and
from it will run to from 7 to 10 hours.</p>

<p>In digging trenches, the usual extension is
to two full paces per man. Where there is little
probability of attack the following method may
be adopted: Halt party about four paces in
rear of the left flank of the general line of
trenches required to be dug; then form single
rank, march ahead of party to the commencement
of task and indicate to the first man his
task, stepping off the next two paces for the
next man, and so on until you have your party
all placed. This takes a very short time and is
one of the best methods. Allow the men to
remove their equipment, but do not allow them
to throw it any place they like. It is a general
rule to place it about four paces to the rear of
their task. Where attacks are possible, rifles
must be kept within easy reach.</p>

<div id="hdr_33" class="chapter">
<h2 id="TRAVERSED_FIRE_TRENCHES">TRAVERSED FIRE TRENCHES</h2>
</div>

<p>The following is a method for extending men
to dig by night a traversed and recessed fire
trench which is not already traced:</p>

<blockquote class="hang">

<p>1. Detailing a covering party to guard
against sudden attack.</p>

<p>2. Extension of the remainder to two paces.</p>

<p>3. Number quietly down the line by 4s.</p>

<p>4. Nos. 1 and 4 stop 2 paces back (these men
then become traverse men).</p>

<p>5. Nos. 2 and 4 drive in their picks (half way
between themselves and left-hand neighbors
and in line with their toes).</p>

<p>6. Front rank to mark out tasks (Nos. 2 and
3 commence from the pick between them
and mark out 7½ feet each way, that is,
2½ pick-handles’ distance).</p>

<p>7. Rear rank mark out tasks (commencing
from pick between Nos. 1 and 4 to end
of each recess).</p></blockquote>

<p>As soon as this is done the men commence
work, the officer going down the line at once to
check any errors before they have gone too far.
While this may sound very complicated it will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span>
be found that after a little training the men become
accustomed to it and it is a very simple
matter. This method renders unnecessary the
giving of many orders in the dark once the men
are extended, and prevents a great amount of
confusion. There will always be a slight
amount of readjustment of the work, such as
the widening of traverses, etc., but it is easily
done after the work has been started and even
after the trench has been dug to some depth.</p>

<hr />
<div id="hdr_34" class="chapter">
<h2 id="OBSTACLES_AND_ENTANGLEMENTS">OBSTACLES AND ENTANGLEMENTS</h2>
</div>

<p>The purpose of an obstacle is to obtain the
control of the enemies in respect to direction
and speed during an attack, and to deflect
troops into areas favorable to their destruction
by the defenders. They break up the unity of
action, deflect parties isolated into the best
swept fields of fire and hold them under close
fire of the defenses. An obstacle should be
close to the defender’s position, not more than
80 yards away at the most. A system is now in
use on the Western Front where entanglements
in front of trenches are placed approximately
20 yards from the parapet, as that has been
found to be the distance at which the deadliest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span>
bombing can be done. They should be sheltered
or screened, when possible, from enemy artillery,
giving no cover to the enemy and be so
placed as to surprise the enemy. They should
not interfere with any counter attack necessary
to be made and have occasional gaps, which may
be mined. Types of obstacles are low wire
entanglements, their height depending on the
condition existing in No Man’s Land; high wire
entanglements, barricades, mines, inundations,
etc. Wire plays the important part in most of
the obstacles now being used on all fronts, and
is generally used, first, as a trip wire stretched
just above the ground, or fastened in loose coils
to short pickets. Flares and alarm guns and
tin cans may be used in connection with this;
second: a simple fence to cause delay and confusion
to the enemy at night; third: as a concealed
obstacle in fords and standing crops or
long grass; fourth: as a help towards making
hedges and brushwood impassable, and as a
wire entanglement solely.</p>

<p>The wire entanglements are the best obstacles,
as they are quickly and easily made, are
very difficult to destroy and offer no obstruction
to fire in view of the defenses.</p>

<p id="hdr_35" class="section"><span class="smcap">Low Wire Entanglements.</span> Stout sticks, 36
inches long and 1½ to 2 inches in diameter, are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span>
driven into the ground on level at 6-foot intervals.
These should be driven in at least three
rows so arranged that the sticks in one row are
opposite the centers of gaps in the next. The
heads of the sticks are connected by strong
wires crossing diagonally from 12 to 18 inches
above the ground.</p>

<p id="hdr_36" class="section"><span class="smcap">High Wire Entanglements.</span> To be effective,
high wire entanglements should prevent
the enemy from crawling through it at or near
the ground level, and when possible, should be
screened from enemy artillery observation.
This obviously is utterly impossible as far as
wire entanglements in front of the firing line is
concerned, but it is possible to a certain extent
to screen these high entanglements from observation
in front of support lines and second line
systems. Under conditions existing at the
front, the wire work is often and generally, for
very good reasons, of a hasty character, and it
is best, therefore, to limit the first stage to just
enough to form a nucleus of the whole entanglement,
in order that the required area may be
covered by obstacle before serious interruption
occurs. To do this, the obstacle is best constructed
in two zones, with a small space between.
The pickets should be from 5 to 8 feet
long and average five inches in diameter, being<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span>
placed at irregular distances and with varying
heights in order to make more difficult the passage
over them by means of hurdles and planks.
The outer pickets should be very firmly driven
and stayed to prevent the enemy dragging the
obstacle away. It is also nice to drive large
nails into the tops of the posts with half their
length projecting. After the posts are driven
in, they are first joined diagonally, that is, from
head to foot and foot to head, by winding the
wire around each post and securing it by staples.
Each set of posts should be stayed by
four wires. There should be a trip wire 9
inches from the ground, or even less, running
continuously round the outer posts, and another
one foot from the top of the middle posts. The
barbed wire can then be hung in festoons between
the posts on no fixed pattern and fastened
to them. It must also be fastened to the
other wire where it crosses, by short lengths of
wire especially cut beforehand. Slack wires are
of more hindrance when cut than taut wires.
Tight wires help the enemy’s advance by giving
support to hurdles and other methods used to
get across these entanglements. One method
once used by the Germans was the carrying out
of mattresses and endeavoring to cover the
wire obstacles in that manner, and had the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span>
wire been taut it would have been a success, but
as it happened, it was not.</p>

<p>The ground on the enemy’s side and within
the entanglement, as a matter of courtesy, is
strewn with broken glass and tangled wire. The
whole system of entanglement should be under
well-controlled machine gun fire from special
points and should be widest where the fire of
the defenders is least effective by night. There
should be one sentry at least to each 50 yards
of entanglement.</p>

<p id="hdr_37" class="section"><span class="smcap">Abatis.</span> A form of obstacle made by trees
cut down and laid side by side as close as possible
with their branches towards the enemy is
used. These should be in a hollow and screened
from view to make it of any value. The butts
of the trees should be firmly secured by burying
them in the earth, or by laying logs of timber
across several butts. Wire and barbed wire
must then be interlaced between the boughs,
which should also be sharpened to points on the
enemy side. Some of the lower branches may
be pegged to the ground, if thought necessary,
to insure the maximum resistance.</p>

<p id="hdr_38" class="section"><span class="smcap">Barricades.</span> These are used for the defense
of streets, roads, bridges, etc., and are made of
any available materials, including furniture and
vehicles, either overthrown or with wheels removed,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span>
carts filled with earth, railings, bales of
goods, etc. Where trees are growing along the
roadside, fell them across it and entangle with
wire.</p>

<p>It must be kept in mind, though, that passages
are required through these barricades to
allow outposts to advance or retreat, that these
passages, viewed from the front, must not appear
as openings. To avoid this the barricade
should be made in two parts, one overlapping
the other. Sometimes, where there is a gap in a
row of houses, or a sharp bend in the road, a
barricade may be made in one part and a passage
round one end left for traffic.</p>

<p id="hdr_39" class="section"><span class="smcap">Inundations</span>. They may be formed by damming
streams at convenient points, specially in
the valleys, or by damming up the arches of
bridges. In the latter case, care must be taken
not to endanger the stability of the bridge. The
ditches of field works form a good obstacle when
flooded. Destroyed trenches in front of a
breastworks may be filled with water, and with
barbed wire thrown into it, will prove an effective
obstacle.</p>

<p id="hdr_40" class="section"><span class="smcap">Fougasses</span>. These are used in connection
with obstacles and are really land mines loaded
with stones, bricks, etc. An excavation is made
in conical shape with an axis inclined to about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span>
40 degrees toward the enemy horizon. A box
of powder is then placed in a recess at the bottom
and on the box is placed a wooden platform
or shield 3 to 4 inches thick, over which stones
are piled.</p>

<p>A fuse is placed in a groove cut at the back
of the excavation. A line of least resistance
must be so arranged that by placing the excavated
earth on the back edge of the fougasse,
the powder will act in the direction of the axis
and not vertically. A fougasse charged with
80 pounds of powder may be constructed in this
manner to throw five tons of brick and stone
over a surface about 160 yards long by 120
yards wide.</p>

<p>All of the foregoing are labors of working
parties, as well as construction of dugouts,
carrying of supplies, ammunition, etc., drainage
and building of the trenches and the many other
jobs behind the lines. Always, no matter how
small the job, careful forethought must be given
to the planning and arrangement necessary to
carry it out.</p>

<hr />
<div id="hdr_41" class="chapter">
<h2 id="ORGANIZATION_OF_BOMBING_SQUADS">ORGANIZATION OF BOMBING SQUADS</h2>
</div>

<p>Every infantry soldier must and does receive
instruction in grenade throwing. Some men<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span>
do not possess the temperament and qualifications
necessary to make efficient bombers, and
for this reason in every platoon there should
be a bombing squad of one N. C. O. and 8 men,
with a higher degree of training and efficiency
as bomb throwers than the remainder, although
all hope must not be given up for the remainder.</p>

<p>These men are available either to work with
the platoon or to provide a reserve of bombers
for any special job, such as raids, cutting-out
parties, and clearing trenches just occupied.
Only the very best men in each platoon should
be chosen, taking into consideration physique,
courage and steadiness, although it is not always
the big man physically that makes the
best bomber. The responsibility for the training
of these men rests with the battalion and
company commanders.</p>

<hr />
<div id="hdr_42" class="chapter">
<h2 id="TRAINING">TRAINING</h2>
</div>

<p>The first step is to overcome a man’s natural
fear of the grenade itself. This is only done by
explaining how it is to be used, the method of
lighting and the length of time taken for the
fuse to burn. A good idea is to have some of
the fuses of the length used lighted and the men<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span>
told to count while the fuse burns out. Dummy
grenades with fuses attached can then be introduced
and the men taught to light them, observing
carefully how long it takes for the fuse
to burn down to the grenade.</p>

<p>The second step is to develop accuracy in
throwing. Normally, the bomb should be bowled
overhand, although it is certainly not wrong to
throw, but it has been found in tests that a man
throwing bombs has tired a great deal quicker
than a man bowling them overhand.</p>

<p>Stick grenades may be thrown over short distances
like a dart, although this is unhandy and
can only be done by a carefully trained man.
Great care must be taken while in the trenches
in throwing percussion bombs, as very often a
man swinging his arm back to throw such a
bomb has exploded it in the trench, with disaster
to himself and those near him.</p>

<p>Men should be taught to throw standing,
kneeling and prone. It should be impressed
upon them from the beginning that if a grenade
with a time fuse is dropped in the act of throwing
there is ample time to pick it up and throw
it out of the trench before it explodes, but this
must be done immediately.</p>

<div id="ip_92" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 38em;">
  <img src="images/i_093.png" width="600" height="394" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">A <span class="in4">B</span></div></div>

<p>A is a diagram of a bombing field where men
are trained in practice with dummy bombs. 1 is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span>
the target marked on the ground and having the
same general plan as a firing target, with Bull,
Inner, Magpie, and Outer, the score counting
5, 4, 3, &amp; 2 respectively, or according to the instructor’s
taste. 2 is the first line, 20 yards
from the center of the inner ring. The men
<em>must</em> be trained to a high degree of accuracy
at this range. 3 is the second line, 25 yards
from the center of target. There are lines every
five yards back until the 40 yard line is reached,
which latter is the extreme range for bombing
practice.</p>

<p>At each range the men should practice standing,
kneeling, and prone. At 35 and 40 yards
bombing from the kneeling and prone positions
is very difficult and the time spent on practice
here should not interfere with the obtaining of
great accuracy at the shorter ranges.</p>

<p>At all ranges the men should be allowed to
throw any number of dummy bombs, but should
not be permitted to fatigue their arms.</p>

<p>B is a diagram showing the arrangement for
trench practice with dummy bombs. Small
trenches are built on the surface of the ground
by screens of wire mesh covered with burlap or
other similar material. 1 is the thrower’s trench
and is built so high that he cannot see over
the top. From this he throws, using a periscope<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span>
for observation. 2 represents part of a traverse
and fire-bay, the front part of which is
about 20 yards from the throwing trench. 3 is
a section of straight trench about 25 yards half
right from the thrower’s front. 4 is a section
of curved trench about 20 yards half left from
the thrower’s front.</p>

<p>The general custom in the practice trenches
is to give the man any desirable number of
dummy bombs, say 18; 6 for each trench. Four
out of six are required to be put in No. 2, and 3
out of 6 in Nos. 3 &amp; 4. Men must not be kept
at bombing practice too long at a time as it
spoils both their interest and their aim.</p>

<p>In taking a line of trenches, it is well to remember
that the attack will take place on a
relatively small front by a large number of men,
and therefore when the trenches are finally
reached, there is liable to be great overcrowding
in them. This can only be prevented by extending
them along the trenches as quickly as possible,
and is of the utmost importance as heavy
casualties will result from allowing this overcrowding.
To make this extending possible, it
is the duty of the bombing parties to work along
to both flanks of the trenches and take advantage
of the temporary confusion of the enemy
by obtaining as much of his trenches as possible,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span>
thus allowing for the extension of men. In a
narrow trench the only portion of an attacking
party coming into contact with the enemy is
the head, or what is known as the Bayonet Man.
The bombing party is composed of the following:</p>

<p class="in0 in4">
1. Bayonet man,<br />
2. First thrower,<br />
3. First carrier,<br />
4. First spade man,<br />
5. N. C. O. first squad,<br />
6. Second bayonet man,<br />
7. Second thrower,<br />
8. Second carrier,<br />
9. Spade man, in charge of second party.
</p>

<p>These parties will work up a trench until they
come to a junction, when the first party in
charge of the N. C. O. will continue straight on
and the second party branch to the right or left,
as the case may be, and as they come on other
parties keep working up behind them, and the
infantry gradually following taking possession
of the line and starting consolidation work at
once.</p>

<p>Communication throughout these lengths of
grenade parties is very difficult with men extended<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">97</span>
in single file, and the attendant confusion
which accompanies such a stand.</p>

<p>A system is required which will enable supplies
of bombs to be passed up and casualties
replaced automatically. This system cannot be
laid down on any cut and dried lines, but must
be figured out before the attack, with due consideration
being given to the line of trenches
to be attacked and the difficulties which will be
encountered in getting supplies to that line, and
it is only on the spot that such a system can be
worked out.</p>

<p>During an attack three grenades per man are
issued to each unit detailed to open the attack,
and these grenades are turned over to the bombers
or used by the men themselves if necessary.
When out of grenades themselves, the men
take over the casualty’s, and it is the duty of a
casualty when he is so able to, to leave his grenades
and ammunition to the care of some other
man before “going down.” Small depots
should be established at frequent intervals
along the trenches from which the attack starts,
with careful consideration given to their safety
from shell fire, if at all possible. Other depots
must be established in the support and assembly
trenches, and these will generally be supplied<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span>
through a central station probably controlled
by a brigade or division.</p>

<p>Before starting the attack, every man and
party should have had explained them in detail
exactly what is required of them, and generally
the following system is adopted:</p>

<blockquote class="hang">

<p>First bombing party of <span class="locked">group—</span></p>

<p>Two bayonet men to protect grenade throwers,</p>

<p>First bomber,</p>

<p>First carrier,</p>

<p>Second bomber,</p>

<p>Second carrier,</p>

<p>Group leader (N. C. O.),</p>

<p>Two bayonet men to protect the group leader and the rear of party.</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>Second bombing <span class="locked">party—</span></p>

<p>Formation as above. The head of the party
must be in touch with the rear of the first
party. Officer commanding in rear of second
party.</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>Third and fourth bombing <span class="locked">party—</span></p>

<p>Formation as above. Second in command in
touch with rear of fourth party.</p>

<p>Machine gun detachment, if available or considered
necessary.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">99</span>
The machine gunners are generally used at
the rear of a party, so that they can bring their
guns into action from behind and sweep the top
of the ground around the trenches being attacked,
in order to prevent an overland attack
on the bombing party. In all these formations
the number of men detailed must allow for
casualties. Rapidity of movement is essential,
as crawling and stalking will give the waiting
enemy an advantage. The leading bayonet men
generally move along the trench, from corner
to corner, in a succession of rushes, followed
by first bomber, and the thrower hurls as directed
by the bayonet man. The duty of the
bayonet man is to protect the thrower and carrier
at all costs. Second bomber and carrier
follow the leader, keeping one corner behind to
replace casualties. Each party must be regarded
as reserves to the party in front, and
some method must be found every time a new
attack is carried out for giving the aerial service
notice of trenches occupied. If the head
of a party is checked, that which has been
gained must be held by throwing up a barricade.
In all attacks bombing parties are supported
by a party of sandbag men, under an experienced
N. C. O., so that while bombers keep<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">100</span>
the enemy at bay a strong barracade may be
put up as quickly as possible.</p>

<p>This is generally done by placing what is
known as a demolition tube about 1½ feet from
the bottom of the trench and in each side of the
trench. This will bring down enough of the
sides of the trench to make a good enough barricade
for the moment, but great care must be
taken that while watching and protecting the
barricade the enemy do not come overland and
drop in behind the barricade, with disastrous
results to the garrison.</p>

<p>Although the main defense of a line of
trenches is infantry supported by artillery and
machine gun fire, parties of bombers should be
distributed throughout the front system of
trenches. The best position is in the support
trenches close to the main communication
trenches, where they can make an immediate
counter-attack should the enemy succeed in
gaining a footing. A bombing trench back about
20 yards in the rear from which bombs may be
thrown into the front trench, is a distinct advantage.</p>

<p>The bombs stored in the trench should be kept
ready-fused and with detonators inserted.
They must be distributed in a number of dry,
enclosed, as nearly as bomb-proof depots as possible,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">101</span>
established at frequent intervals along the
trenches. A good type of grenade depot is one
built in a “T” shaped trench, slightly off the
main trench.</p>

<h2 id="EXPLOSIVES">EXPLOSIVES</h2>
</div>

<p>Relative strengths of explosives: Gunpowder
5; cordite 8; dynamite 9; guncotton 10;
gelignite 10; gelatine dynamite 11; blasting
gelatine 12. Guncotton is available in two
forms, wet and dry. The dry, while being utilized
in making bombs, is mostly used to explode
the wet guncotton. For this purpose it is
made up in one-ounce primers, which are perforated
in the center for a detonator. These
primers are packed in metal cylinders, each
containing ten threaded on a tape. Each case
contains six cylinders. In this state, although
not as powerful, dry guncotton is much more
dangerous to handle than wet, being susceptible
to both shock and friction.</p>

<p>Wet guncotton is that which has absorbed
30% of its weight in water, and is made up in
15-ounce slabs 6 x 3 x 1⅜ inches, and packed in
tin foil and air-tight boxes containing 16 slabs
each.</p>

<p>Whether wet or dry, guncotton, like other explosives,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span>
can be exploded by one detonator, so
long as the charges or slabs are in direct contact
with each other.</p>

<p>Dynamites include the following compounds:
(1) dynamite; (2) gelignite; (3) gelatine dynamite;
(4) blasting gelatine. All of these are
now being used. Their advantages over guncotton
are that, being soft and plastic, they can
be used in bombs where it would be impossible
to use guncotton slabs or primers on account
of size and shape. Dynamite and its compounds
freeze very easily (42° F.), becoming hard
and brittle. In this state they are exceptionally
dangerous, and they should be thawed before
use, but this process should not be attempted
by any one other than a competent person.
Wooden implements should always be
used for cutting and piercing holes for detonators
in any of these explosives, and care
should be taken to protect them from damp, as
when wet they become highly dangerous.
Dynamite explosives are usually supplied in
parchment cartridges weighing two ounces, and
are packed in boxes of 5 or 50 pounds.</p>

<p>Lyddite and picric acid are both high explosives,
used mostly in shells. They are easily
melted and in this way the shell is filled. They
are very safe and difficult to detonate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">103</span>
Ammonal. A new explosive which is absolutely
safe to handle, not being sensitive to
shock or even bullets. It does not freeze and
can only be exploded by means of a detonator.
It easily absorbs moisture and should be kept
dry.</p>

<p>Cordite. Is made in strands and is the explosive
used in small arms ammunition.</p>

  <div class="caption"><i><span class="smcap">Hand Grenade No. 1.</span></i></div></div>

<p id="hdr_46" class="subsection"><i>Hand Grenade No. 1</i> consists of a brass case<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span>
screwed on to a block of wood, to which is fixed
a small cane handle about half way up the case.
Outside it is a cast iron ring serrated into 16
parts. The upper end is covered by a moveable
cap with a striker pin in the center. On
the cap are the words “Remove,” “Travel,”
and “Fire” in duplicate. These are marked
in red and can be made to correspond with red
pointers painted on case. To prepare a bomb,
turn cap so that pointer is at “Remove,” take
off cap, insert detonator in hole and turn it to
the left until the spring on the flange is released
and goes into position under the pin; replace
cap and turn to “Travel,” which is a
safety position. When the bomb is to be
thrown, turn cap to “Fire” and then remove
safety pin. This bomb explodes on impact, and
to insure its falling on the head, streamers are
attached. Care should be taken that streamers
do not get entangled. The bomb must be thrown
well into the air.</p>

<p id="hdr_47" class="subsection"><i>Hand Grenade No. 2</i> is similar to the above,
except that a special detonator is screwed in
from the head, and that the striker pin, in this
case, is at the bottom. The detonator having
been inserted in the bomb is ready for throwing
as soon as the safety pin has been drawn.</p>

<p id="hdr_48" class="subsection"><i>Rifle Grenade No. 3</i>, more commonly known<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span>
as Hale’s Rifle Grenade, consists of a serrated
steel case filled with T.N.T. and a composite explosive.
At the bottom of the case is a brass
ring fitted with wind vanes, which keeps in place
two small steel retaining plugs, securing the
striker. In order to prepare this grenade for
firing, the steel rod attached must be put down
the bore of the rifle. The safety pin is then
withdrawn, the collar pulled down and the wind
vane given a slight turn. The rifle is then
loaded with a special cartridge containing 43
strands of cordite. When charging the rifle
the bolt must be well pushed home. When the
rifle is fired, the explosion of the cartridge
speeds the grenade on its way and the air passing
through wind vanes causes the ring mentioned
above to unscrew, and the two retaining
plugs to fall out. The striker is now free, and
when the grenade reaches its destination and
comes in contact with the ground the shock compresses
the creep spring and the needle of the
striker is forced into the detonator, exploding
the grenade.</p>

<p>Special screw-in detonators are supplied with
this grenade, as well as in Grenade No. 2, and
care should be taken not to mix the two detonators,
as the Rifle Grenade Detonator is
slightly longer, and if fixed in the wrong grenade<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">107</span>
will cause premature explosion and much
sadness. These grenades have an accurate
range of from 250 to 350 yards.</p>

<div id="hdr_58" class="chapter">
<h2 id="GAS_WARFARE">GAS WARFARE</h2>
</div>

<p>The use of poisonous and asphyxiating gases,
which was first adopted by the Germans in the
Ypres salient in April of 1915, is now becoming
an accepted fact in the present war. It is to
a certain extent in one shape or another, before
one every day of his life in or near the trenches.
Every one should therefore be well acquainted
with the various ways in which gases are used
in an attack, as well as precautionary methods
to be taken in counteracting its effects while on
the defense.</p>

<p>In an attack there are only two methods which
can be used—emanation and shells and grenades.
The emanation method can only be employed
under very favorable circumstances and
in a few cases where rather a long chance was
taken, it reacted very badly on the enemy. The
first thing to make a gas attack successful must
be a favorable breeze of about five miles an
hour, as if the wind blows any faster it does
not give the gas a chance to settle down into the
trenches. The object of this gas is to create
a poisonous and irritant atmosphere, and this is
accomplished either by a gas forced through<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">114</span>
tubes in the direction of the enemy, or a liquefied
gas stored in cylinders under very high
pressure. To be successful, as before mentioned,
the wind must be a steady breeze of not
much over 5 miles per hour, no rain, and the
element of surprise must figure very largely.
The gas used must be heavier than air and not
allow of being held back by any protective measures
taken by the enemy. If the wind is too
strong, it is obvious that any gas employed
will be carried too quickly over the enemy’s
trenches, so that it cannot settle to any degree
which will allow of its obtaining the desired effect.
If the wind is too light, it will be carried
up into the air by local eddies, or may even be
blown back.</p>

<p>For these reasons it is impossible to fix a
definite hour for gas attacks, as everything depends
on the wind.</p>

<p>Arsenic and phosphorus compounds are used
in the tube method, and their presence can be
detected at once by the smell of garlic. Should
such gases get into your own trenches, chloride
of lime scattered freely about will disperse
them.</p>

<p>The gases used in liquid form from cylinders
are a mixture of chlorine and other matter
annoying to the ordinary infantry officer and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">115</span>
soldier. If successful in surprising the enemy,
their trenches should be cleared at once, but if
the element of surprise is not there and time is
given for defensive measures to be taken, the
effect is lost. In an assault following a gas
attack, men should always wear smoke helmets
for at least 30 minutes after the gas dissemination
has ceased, and the assaulting party must
have the strictest orders not to remove their
helmets until the officer in charge has given the
command.</p>

<p>In the shell and grenade method of dissemination,
shells and bombs are used containing
liquid gas, or a substance which gives off irritant
fumes.</p>

<p>It is easy to tell a gas shell when it lights as
it comes down, the same as a “dud” shell; that
is, one which does not explode, the outer casing
of the shell simply collapsing. The liquid soaks
into the ground, and men should be warned
against standing over this ground and inhaling
any of the fumes, which are very slight and
rather hard to notice but very powerful and
with very quick action. When a man thinks
he has inhaled any of this gas he should at once
be made to lie down, not undergo any exercise
whatever, and as soon as possible have him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">116</span>
carried out on a stretcher to the dressing station.</p>

<p id="hdr_59" class="section"><i>Tear shells</i>, which are used in great profusion
during an attack, are for the moment blinding
in their effect, causing smarting of the eyes
and a great amount of watering. This effect is
only for a minute, and the men must be impressed
with the fact that if they continue moving
forward instead of sitting down and rubbing
their eyes, it will pass off almost at once. These
shells are also greatly used against the artillery
during heavy bombardments. Adequate protection
is furnished in the shape of goggles to fit
over the eyes, as the gas has no other effect
whatever.</p>

<p>As in other branches of military art, the best
means of learning defense is to have a thorough
knowledge of attack. Thus, direction of
wind must always be noted, and if favorable
for an enemy attack, special observers must be
placed to give warning and surprise guarded
against in every way. Sentries are specially
placed in the trench, and often in listening posts,
to get early warnings of an impending attack.
If a sentry at a listening post discovers that a
gas attack is being made, he at once warns the
sentry at the end of his cord or wire, giving a
pre-arranged signal. This sentry passes the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">117</span>
alarm on a Strombon horn, which is something
similar to a Klaxton, and will automatically
give a warning which can be heard for 3 or
4 miles, and which lasts about a minute.</p>

<p>When a horn is not in use, generally shell
cases are hung in the trenches. These are beat
on by the sentry who is warned and taken up
all along the line. It is then the duty of that
sentry not for the instant to put on his gas helmet,
but to proceed along the front line waking
all the occupants of dugouts, etc., who may be
sleeping in the area guarded by him. Every
man without exception stands to in his trench
with his helmet on and will not reënter dugouts
until first given permission by officer or N. C. O.</p>

<p>These attacks are generally carried out, when
possible, just before dawn or during the middle
of the night, and the only warning given before
the actual gas reaches a trench, is a slight hissing
sound which is made and can be easily heard
as the gas escapes from the cylinder. Great
care must be taken when the wind is favorable
for an attack that this sound be listened for.</p>

<p>Any man wounded during a gas attack must
not be placed in a dugout or on the bottom of a
trench, and even if considerable shell fire be going
on it is far better that he be laid out in the
open on the top of the ground, where he will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">118</span>
have a far better chance than lying in the bottom
of the trench or in a dugout. After gas
has passed through a trench system, and before
the officer thinks that it is safe to remove the
helmets, the trenches must be sprayed with a
machine known as Vermeral Sprayer. A man
with this sprayer on his back and wearing his
helmet, slowly traverses the trench working the
spray. This small tank on his back is charged
with nothing more or less than “hypo” (sodium
hyposulphite), about 6 pounds of which is dissolved
in a bucket of water and a handful of
ordinary washing soda added.</p>

<p>Garden syringes and buckets may be used if
sprayers are not available, but their effect is
not so quick.</p>

<p>When the officer thinks that the trench has
been sprayed sufficiently and all gas has gone,
he may then allow the men to take off their helmets,
but not to reënter their dugouts until they
have been thoroughly cleaned.</p>

<p>This is sometimes done by fanning the gas
out, sometimes by building a fire and smoking
it out, and by the use of the sprayer. Great care
must be taken that no one enters until every last
vestige of gas is gone, and it is generally well
that the medical officer should inspect infected
dugouts before allowing the men to return.</p>

<h2 id="GAS_MASKS_OR_RESPIRATORS">GAS MASKS OR RESPIRATORS</h2>
</div>

<p>The Box Respirator at present in use on the
Western Front is the latest improvement, and
proof against any gas that so far has been used,
but should such a thing happen that a man be
caught without his box respirator, any of the
following improvised methods are good:</p>

<p>1. Wet and ring out any woolen article, such
as a stocking, muffler or cap comforter, so as to
form a thick pad large enough to cover the
nose and mouth, and press firmly over both.</p>

<p>2. Place in a scarf, stocking or handkerchief,
a pad of about three handfuls of damp earth,
and tie firmly over the nose and mouth.</p>

<p>3. A wet cap comforter will be found useful
as additional protection, especially against certain
gases other than chlorine.</p>

<p>4. A cap comforter wetted with water and
soda solution or tea, folded into eight folds and
firmly held over the nose.</p>

<p>5. A sock folded fourfold similarly wetted
and held or tied. If the sock or comforter has
been soaked in soda solution it will act efficiently
when dry, though, if possible, it should be
moist. The spare tapes from puttees may be
used for tying on the sock or cap comforter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">120</span>
6. Any loose fabric, such as a sock, sandbag,
woolen scarf or comforter, soaked in urine, then
wrung out sufficiently to allow of free breathing
and tied tightly over the nose and mouth.</p>

<p>In the absence of any other cloths, the flannel
waistbands issued for winter use could be used
for this purpose.</p>

<p>Every officer defending a trench against an
enemy gas attack should endeavor to collect information
whenever possible to be sent to headquarters
regarding the capture of apparatus
used by the enemy either for disseminating or
protection from gas. If a gas shell attack is
made, unexploded shells or portions of them
should be sent; the time of day, duration of attack,
color, taste or smell of gas used, effect on
the eyes, breathing, and all other symptoms
should be noted. New gases may be used at any
time, and speedy information greatly helps the
adopting of protective measures.</p>

<p>The area of the gas attack is very large and
will sometimes cover as far back as 12 to 15
miles behind the lines, although at that point
it is not generally dangerous, but for three to
four miles the gas has a killing power, and precaution
should be taken anywhere within that
length of the firing line the same as though in
the firing line.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">121</span>
Another nuisance resulting from a gas attack
is the wholesale slaughter of rats and other
animals that infest the trenches, and while a
very unpleasant job, steps should at once be
taken to gather these beasts up and bury them
in some place, obviously for sanitary reasons.</p>

<h2 id="DUTIES_OF_A_PLATOON_COMMANDER_AT">DUTIES OF A PLATOON COMMANDER AT
THE FRONT</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">General Notes</span>: The selection and training
of section commanders is of the highest importance,
and a commander must assure himself
that the man selected has the confidence of the
men as well as his own.</p>

<p>A platoon commander should know his men
and all about them, and keep a record in a book
arranged in sections always kept up-to-date.
This is easy to say, but harder to do, when the
platoon changes day by day.</p>

<p>He should know his drill and be capable of
moving the platoon into any position easily
and by the shortest possible route.</p>

<p>He should know how to organize a task allotted
to him, such as delivering over a working
party, placing a line of sentries, arranging<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">122</span>
posts and reliefs, and occupying a line of
trenches.</p>

<p>He should be able to assume responsibility
for all trench stores, bombs, periscopes, etc.,
handed over to him.</p>

<p>He should know the geography of his battalion
trenches, the position of company and
battalion headquarters, and keep trained guides
at hand who can find their way to all important
points by day or night.</p>

<div id="hdr_62" class="chapter">
<h2 id="GOING_INTO_THE_TRENCHES">GOING INTO THE TRENCHES</h2>
</div>

<p>Platoons generally enter by not more than
two sections at a time, thus minimizing the danger
from shell fire and delay at entrance to communication
trenches.</p>

<p>Before leaving billets, platoon commanders
should explain fully to sergeants and sections
commanders the extent of trench to be taken
over and the steps to be taken in case they are
caught by shelling or rapid fire going up to
the trenches. Arrangements should also be
made that if casualties occur among the soldiers,
relief will proceed as arranged.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">123</span></p>

<div id="hdr_63" class="chapter">
<h2 id="IN_THE_FIRING_LINE">IN THE FIRING LINE</h2>
</div>

<p>On relieving the fire trenches, the men should
make no noise, and rifles must be carried so
that they do not show over the parapet. This
is necessary even if enemy’s trenches are at a
distance, as there is always the possibility of a
listening or observation post being quite near.</p>

<p>Each man should pair off with one of the
party occupying the trench and find out from
him any points which may be useful.</p>

<p>A commander should consult the officer or
N. C. O. in charge of the outgoing party and
obtain the fullest information possible in connection
with the position.</p>

<p>Particular points on which information
should be obtained from the outgoing officer
are generally: (a) behavior of enemy during
period preceding relief and any point in their
line requiring special information, such as
enemy may have cut wire as though preparing
to attack; (b) machine gun implacement may
be suspected at some particular point; (c) anything
ascertained by patrols about ground between
firing lines, thus avoiding unnecessary
reconnoissance; (d) any standing arrangement
for patrols at night, including point at which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">124</span>
wire can best be passed, ground to be patrolled,
or place where they can lie under cover; (e)
any parts of trench from which it is not safe
to fire. Such positions are apt to occur in winding
trenches, and are not always recognizable
in the dark; (f) special features of trench, recent
improvements, work not completed, dangerous
points (on which enemy machine guns
are trained at night), useful loopholes for observation;
(g) places from which wood and
water can be safely obtained; (h) amount of
ammunition, number of picks, shovels and
empty sandbags in that section of the line.</p>

<p>Information on these points cannot always
be given by word of mouth. Written notes and
plans should, therefore, be handed over to a
platoon commander taking over for the first
time.</p>

<p>In the meantime the incoming party should
fix bayonets and all go temporarily on sentry at
posts taken over. Occasional shots should be
fired, so that the enemy’s suspicions may not
be roused. The outgoing party then starts
back, and when clear, the relieving party should
be numbered off and sentries posted and dugouts
allotted. When practicable sentries should
be taken from the dugout closest to his post.</p>

<p>By day the number of sentries varies, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">125</span>
should not be less than one in six. The platoon
sergeant is responsible for changing sentries,
who are generally not on duty more than one
hour at a time, unless under exceptional circumstances.
When the maximum amount of
labor must be obtained from the battalion holding
the line, sentry duty is of any length that
fits in with working arrangements.</p>

<p>Every man must see that he has a good clear
position for all directions. Section commanders
must satisfy themselves that men have done
this and reported such. When these arrangements
are completed, word must be quietly
passed down for men not on sentry to stand
clear, and they are all not in that position again
until the “Stand to” hours, generally the hour
nearest dusk and the hour before dawn.</p>

<p>After dark, unless the moon is bright, rifles
should be kept in a firing position on the parapet,
and all men not on duty should keep rifles
with bayonets fixed while in the trench.</p>

<p id="hdr_64" class="section"><span class="smcap">Observation.</span> Continuous survey of the enemy’s
lines through disguised steel loopholes
should be made when the trenches are being
held for any lengthy period, and such loopholes
must always be sideways. Sites may be
chosen by day, and made and disguised by
night. Two steel loopholes about 3 yards apart<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">126</span>
enable a man with leveled rifle to wait by one
while another with field glasses watches for
target through the other.</p>

<p>An observer watching persistently through
glasses in complete security should make himself
so familiar with the look of the opposite
trenches as to enable him to observe any alteration
in the enemy’s wire entanglements, or
notice immediately if a new sap has been run
out from the enemy trenches under cover of
night. He should watch points suspected of being
machine gun implacements, and especially
at night when the flashes can be detected. Observers
should be told what marks, etc., to look
for on men exposing themselves, and any result
of these observations at once reported to
the officer or N. C. O.</p>

<p id="hdr_65" class="section"><span class="smcap">Inspection.</span> A platoon commander should
make frequent examination of trenches; at least
once daily, go around with platoon sergeant
and section commanders and decide on the necessary
work to be done. Section commanders
are responsible for carrying it out.</p>

<p>Before handing over a trench, a platoon commander
should make a rigorous inspection to
see that it is as clean as possible and that
latrines are left in a satisfactory state. This
includes the removal of old tins, paper, scraps<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">127</span>
of food, etc., which should be buried or burned,
if possible. Empty cartridges should also always
be kept cleared out, as they get imbedded
in trench floors and hinder subsequent digging.</p>

<hr />
<div id="hdr_66" class="chapter">
<h2 id="SENTRIES">SENTRIES</h2>
</div>

<p>If the enemy is close, sentries should be supplied
with a small periscope to fix on sticks or
bayonets. Magazines must be kept as full as
possible. Sentries are not allowed to look over
the parapet by day, but by night they must keep
a continuous lookout. Shots should be fired
even when no lights are showing, on the chance
of catching hostile patrols or working parties.
The best time to watch across No Man’s Land
is exactly the minute that the enemy send up a
Very light, as there is little danger of one being
seen, the real danger coming when the Very
light is coming down behind you. Sentries
should not reply to bursts of rapid fire on the
right or left, unless they have a definite object
to fire at.</p>

<p>Arrangements are usually made for commanders
of two or three neighboring platoons
to divide the night between 10 P.M. and the
time for “Standing to” between them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">128</span>
The platoon commander on duty in each
watch should patrol the line constantly and
satisfy himself that the proper number of sentries
are on duty and keeping a sufficient lookout;
also that they have good firing positions.
In each platoon the sergeant and section commanders
keep watch similarly in turns during
the night, and are responsible for the relief of
sentries. They also visit sentries every hour.</p>

<p>It is a rule which must be strongly enforced,
that every sentry must challenge each person
passing him, as it has often happened that enemy
officers with more daring than common
sense and speaking fluent English, have come
into the trenches and walked up and down without
being molested, which was only made possible
by sentries not challenging every one passing
his post.</p>

<hr />
<div id="hdr_67" class="chapter">
<h2 id="RIFLES">RIFLES</h2>
</div>

<p>Rifles should be inspected every morning in
the trenches by the platoon commander, and at
other times during the day by the sergeant or
section commander, and it should be impressed
on the men that ammunition must be kept clean
or the rifles are apt to jam.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">129</span>
The principal defects of a rifle in the trenches
are:</p>

<p>(a) Mud in the bolt, owing to rifle being
rested on wet parapet or dropped on wet
ground. To remedy this a bolt cover is used,
or when not obtainable, an old sock pulled over
the bolt action gives the desired result.</p>

<p>(b) Muddy ammunition, resulting in mud in
chamber. Remedy: Prohibit placing of ammunition
on ground and provide proper boxes
for it.</p>

<p>(c) Mud in muzzle resulting from rifles being
pushed into the sides of the trench. Remedy:
Careful and frequent inspection. Rifle
barrels must be freed from mud before firing,
or they will be injured.</p>

<p>(d) Sticking of cartridges owing to dirt in
chamber and magazine. Remedy: The keeping
clean of both.</p>

<p>(e) Rust in the lock and insufficient oiling.
Remedy: Bolt and magazine tested daily.
Cartridges never to be kept in the chamber.</p>

<p>It is a standard rule that never from the time
men enter the trenches until they go out, regardless
of what they are doing, does their
equipment come off, not even to lie down to
sleep. During working periods which take the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">130</span>
men to the trenches, their equipment and rifles
must always be carried with them.</p>

<hr />
<div id="hdr_68" class="chapter">
<h2 id="PREPARATORY_TO_ENTERING_TRENCHES">PREPARATORY TO ENTERING TRENCHES</h2>
</div>

<p>Things to be taken note of before entering:</p>

<p>(a) Check periscopes, wire cutters, field
glasses, water carriers, stretchers, field dressings,
emergency rations, smoke helmets, rifles,
identity discs, sandbags, ammunition.</p>

<p>(b) See that water bottles are filled.</p>

<p>(c) Each officer to have an orderly.</p>

<p>(d) Magazines to be charged and bayonets
fixed and unfixed beforehand to insure proper
working. When taking over the trenches, the
first thing to be done is:</p>

<p>(a) Ascertain position of officers’ dugouts.</p>

<p>(b) Arrange telephones.</p>

<p>(c) Check stores, tools, and reserve ammunition,
and its position.</p>

<p>(d) Obtain rough sketch of front and number
of traverses to be manned.</p>

<p>(e) See that entanglements in front of
trenches are absolutely intact.</p>

<p>(f) Arrange for water and ration parties and
find out position of latrines.</p>

<div id="hdr_69" class="chapter">
<h2 id="TAKING_OVER_TRENCHES">TAKING OVER TRENCHES</h2>
</div>

<p>On arrival each sentry is to have a periscope,
the whole company to stand at arms, and each
platoon to have its own ammunition reserve
and all men know where this is. It is of the
greatest importance that every detail and portion
of trench taken over be known, and also
the adjoining trenches as far as they affect the
trenches held. Accurate sketches of the trench
should be made, and periscopes, prismatic compasses
and ruled notebooks are required. General
scale is roughly ¼ inch to 10 yards.
Drains must be watched and every effort made
to keep trenches dry. When large trench mortar
batteries of the enemy are active, men must
be told off to watch for these bombs, as they are
easily seen, and many casualties may be prevented
by timely warning of their coming.</p>

<p>The fire trenches should contain as few men
as possible, and work should be done at night,
the men resting by day.</p>

<hr />
<div id="hdr_70" class="chapter">
<h2 id="SNIPING">SNIPING</h2>
</div>

<p>Each company generally has specially selected
men told off as snipers. Strict discipline<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">132</span>
is necessary. They are generally on duty by
day and excused from night work, and it is the
rule that they are either told off to a definite
post or given what is known as a roving commission.
These men must be expert in building
loopholes of all kinds by day or night, use of
telescopic sights, periscopes, etc., the selection
and judging of good sniping positions, either
for use in front or behind fire trenches; expert
in judging distances, in aiming and trigger
pressing, in laying fixed rifles for night firing,
and in the fixing and laying of rifle batteries.</p>

<hr />
<div id="hdr_71" class="chapter">
<h2 id="PATROLS">PATROLS</h2>
</div>

<p>Patrolling both day and night is of great importance,
and generally during the night each
unit holding a front line sends out several small
patrols which frequently obtain information of
great value and at the same time counter the
enemy’s efforts in this direction.</p>

<p>These patrols generally consist of an officer
and four to six men, according to the job in
view. Sometimes on highly important work,
it is three officers and sufficient orderlies to
carry any valuable information obtained quickly
back to a pre-arranged headquarters.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">133</span>
Bombs, revolvers and trench daggers are the
only weapons of any value on these patrols.
They frequently carry out small operations,
such as raiding parties, cutting out parties, etc.,
obtaining from prisoners taken in this way information
as to what enemy troops are opposing
them in the line.</p>

<p>When a patrol is out every man in the section
of firing line concerned must be warned, as well
as the listening posts, and this cannot be done
too carefully. It is not a sufficient warning to
tell the sentry on duty at the time a patrol goes
out, as men cannot all be trusted to pass on
instructions, and generally word is quietly
passed down the line by an N. C. O. or officer in
person, and never passed from man to man.
At the same time care must be taken to see that
all firing does not cease, as this is undesirable,
obviously arousing the enemy’s suspicions that
something is going on. When these patrols
have to lie out in trying conditions during winter
months, special dugouts should be kept
ready for them on their return.</p>

<h2 id="DUTIES_OF_AN_OFFICER">DUTIES OF AN OFFICER</h2>
</div>

<p>Some of the questions an officer should ask
himself on taking over a trench and keep in
mind during his stay there, are:</p>

<p>1. I am here for two purposes—to do as
much damage as possible to the enemy and to
hold my part of the line at all costs. Am I doing
everything possible to insure my being able
to do this?</p>

<p>2. Do I worry the enemy as much as I might,
and are the periscope rifles, rifle grenades, catapults
and patrols at my disposal organized in
the best way to effect this purpose?</p>

<p>3. Am I doing all I can to make my part of
the line as strong as possible?</p>

<p>4. Should the enemy succeed in getting into
any part of my line, will I be able to at once
bring up a section of bombers for immediate
counter-attack?</p>

<p>5. Do I connect properly with units on my
right and left? Do I know the position of the
nearest support, and the position of all machine
guns in my vicinity, as well as their lines of
fire?</p>

<p>6. Does every man know his firing position,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">135</span>
and can he fire from it over the parapet at the
foot of our wire?</p>

<p>7. Do I do my best to prevent men exposing
themselves needlessly? Have I ascertained and
warned all my men of the places in my part of
the line, including communication trenches,
which are exposed to the fire of hostile snipers?</p>

<p>8. Are my sentries in the right places? Are
they properly posted by N. C. O.’s and have
they received proper instructions? Are the
sentries visited at frequent intervals?</p>

<p>9. Have I always got a man ready to take
messages to company headquarters? Do I realize
that I should at once report any information
I may obtain about the enemy, and that such
information may be of the greatest use to the
highest commanders?</p>

<p>10. Do all my men know their duties in case
of attack, especially the bombers? If the enemy
succeeds in working into my line at any point,
how can I best arrange for counter-attacking
him?</p>

<p>11. Are there any suitable places in my part
of the line which snipers can use? Have I
pointed out to section commanders the portions
of the enemy’s trench which each one is responsible
for keeping under fire, and where the enemy’s
loopholes are?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">136</span>
12. Do I thoroughly understand the best
method of relief and bringing up of ration and
water supplies, and do my men come up into the
trenches in absolute silence?</p>

<p>13. Do my men know their way about the
trenches in various routes to company and battalion
headquarters?</p>

<p>14. Am I acquainted with the arrangements
for access to the artillery and for asking, if
necessary, for their immediate support? Do I
know the location of the nearest telephone?</p>

<p>15. Am I doing my best to collect information
about the enemy, his defenses, his activities
and movements, and especially about his
patrols at night? What points in my front particularly
require patrolling?</p>

<p>16. Are my listening patrols properly detailed?</p>

<p>17. Which is my best way to get through the
parapet in order to go towards the enemy?</p>

<p>18. Do I know the last order regarding the
use of S. O. S., gas and Zeppelin messages, and
do I know exactly what messages to send?</p>

<p>19. Are the arrangements in case of gas attack
complete and known to all ranks? Do I
know the gong position, and does the sentry
know the orders as to sounding it?</p>

<p>20. Have my men always got their gas helmets<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">137</span>
on their person and are they in good order?</p>

<p>21. Are my parapets and traverses bullet-proof
everywhere?</p>

<p>22. Is my wire strong enough and am I doing
all I can to prevent my trenches from falling
in?</p>

<p>23. Am I doing all I can to drain my
trenches?</p>

<p>24. Have my men got weather-proof places
to sleep in?</p>

<p>25. Are the trenches as clean and sanitary as
they might be? Are live ammunition and
empty shells properly collected? Have I made
all possible arrangements for the collection of
refuse and do the men realize that it must not
be thrown over the parapets or in the sump-pits
for sanitary reasons?</p>

<p>26. Where are my small ammunition and
bomb stores, and are they under cover from
weather?</p>

<p>27. Are all my rifles and ammunition clean
and in good order, and have all my men rifle
covers? Are their magazines always charged?</p>

<p>28. Am I doing all I can to prevent my men
from getting trench feet? Have my men
greased their feet before entering the trenches,
and have they a pair of spare dry socks to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">138</span>
change? Do my men wear gum boots when it
is not necessary? Have I made all possible arrangements
for drying socks?</p>

<p>29. Are the orders as to wearing equipment
carried out?</p>

<p>30. Are my men using as firewood notice
boards or wood from the defense or from the
engineer or trench stores?</p>

<p>31. Are my men drinking water from any but
authorized sources?</p>

<p>32. Do I know the name of every N. C. O. and
man in my platoon, and do they know mine?</p>

<p>33. Do I insure that my men get sufficient
sleep?</p>

<p>34. Have I sufficient periscopes and are they
in good order?</p>

<p>35. Almost always remember that I am here
for two purposes. Do as much damage to the
enemy with the minimum amount of casualties
resulting from retaliation, and to hold my part
of the line at all costs.</p>

<h2 id="HOW_TO_FIRE_A_MACHINE_GUN_IN_CASE_OF">HOW TO FIRE A MACHINE GUN IN CASE OF

<p>As a machine gun textbook is very dry, and
it is difficult for a man who is not of a mechanical<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">141</span>
turn of mind to obtain the most elementary
knowledge of the action from a book, officers
should lose no time in getting in touch with a
machine gun officer and learn from actual experience,
how to load, fire and rectify simple
stoppage.</p>

<p id="hdr_74" class="section"><span class="smcap">Lewis Gun.</span> To load, put a full magazine on
the magazine post with the cocking handle forward.</p>

<p>Pull back cocking handle to its fullest extent,
and raise tangent sight unless the target is
within 200 yards.</p>

<p>To fire, press the trigger and the gun will
continue to fire as long as pressure on the trigger
is maintained. It will only stop when (a)
the magazine is emptied; (b) stoppage is set
up. To remedy this (1) take off empty magazine
and put on full one, reload relay and fire;
(2) cocking handle stops in one of three positions.
To remedy this one must have a thorough
knowledge of remedying of stoppages.</p>

<p id="hdr_75" class="section"><span class="smcap">Vicker’s Automatic.</span> To load, pass the
brass tack of belt through feed plug (right to
left), pull back crank handle and pull belt to the
left; release handle and belt; repeat this process
and the gun is loaded. Vertical adjustment for
sighting is obtained by moving elevating wheel
on quadrant of tripod, horizontal adjustment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">142</span>
by tapping the rear cross-piece. The clamping
handle is in front of the cross-band of the
tripod. To fire, raise safety catch with first or
second finger (the safety catch is a strip of
steel which is under the thumb-piece or double
button) and press the thumb-piece. The gun
will now fire until pressure is released or until
a stoppage occurs.</p>

<p id="hdr_76" class="section"><span class="smcap">Stoppages.</span> There are four common stoppages,
distinguished by the position of the crank
handle. Remedy: (1) Pull crank handle back
and belt to the left, let go crank handle; (2)
open rear cover, take out lock, remove bent
cartridge from face of lock; (3) hit crank handle
down. If it will not go, lift it a little, pull
belt and hit again; (4) raise crank handle, pull
belt, let go of crank. If not effective, then put
in the spare lock, but unload first. To disable
gun, remove lock and fuse from fire belt
through the breech casing.</p>

<div id="hdr_77" class="chapter">
<h2 id="PREVENTION_OF_FROST_BITE_AND_TRENCH">PREVENTION OF FROST BITE AND TRENCH
FEET</h2>
</div>

<p>These conditions are generally caused by
long standing in cold water and mud, or the
continuous wearing of wet socks, boots and puttees,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">143</span>
and the conditions are accelerated when
the blood circulation in the feet and legs is interfered
with by the use of tight puttees, or
anything calculated to cause constriction of the
lower limbs. They can be prevented or diminished
by constant improvement of trenches and
reducing the time spent in the trenches as far
as the general situation will permit by battalion
arrangements; by insuring that men entering
the trenches are warmly clad in dry boots,
socks, trousers and puttees, and that before
entering, the men’s legs and feet are thoroughly
rubbed with whale oil. Provisions are made for
the men on coming out of the trenches to get
warm shelters, hot foods and facilities for washing
the feet and drying wet clothes, and all
along the line just behind the trenches soup
kitchens are kept where the men may stop on
the way to billet and get hot soup, etc.</p>

<p>The arrangements made when a battalion is
going into the trenches are roughly as follows:</p>

<p>The men’s feet and legs are washed and dried
and then thoroughly rubbed with whale oil and
dry socks put on. A second pair of dry socks is
carried by each man, and when it is possible,
battalion arrangements are made for wet socks
to be brought down from the trenches one night
and dry ones exchanged, this taking place every<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">144</span>
night. This is generally managed by the men
changing in the early morning, the relief party
for that night taking down the wet socks and
bringing in the dry for the next morning.</p>

<p>Hot water must never be used, nor the feet
held near a fire. Where necessary, and circumstances
permit, long gum boots are put on on
entering the trench, while the men’s feet are
still dry, and taken off as soon as they prepare
to leave and handed over as trench stores.</p>

<p>In some parts of the line, where conditions
are very favorable, battalion rest posts are
formed as close to the firing line as permissible,
and men showing signs of suffering from exposure
are frequently attended to.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it

  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,

to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means

Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
